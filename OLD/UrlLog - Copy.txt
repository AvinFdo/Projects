Property Description
The essence of inner city style
A contemporary vitality complements the classical appeal of this inner city Victorian, a home that epitomizes the attraction of living close to cafes, the Abbotsford Convent, Collingwood Children's Farm and trains to the CBD from Collingwood station. Period traditions, projected by the charming façade and an arched hall, introduce a light filled north facing front bedroom with an open fire place and a second, equally inviting double bedroom featuring built in robes. The renovated central bathroom's designer flair enhances the comfort of the accommodation in a distinctively desirably way. A living room rich in character, with reverse cycle heating/cooling, precedes a separate kitchen/dining space that's just completed, impressively appointed and yet to be used while beyond, the landscaped courtyard's leafy privacy, olive trees and seating with storage are accompanied by off street parking access via rear right-of-way - a significant advantage in such a great city edge setting.

Property Description
Denton Mills at its most desirable
Acknowledged as one of William Pitt's distinguished designs, the c1880s Denton Mills were pivotal not only to the industrial growth of Abbotsford but also to the emergence of 'Marvellous Melbourne'. This landmark has, since 2008, gained equally significant status as an inner city residential address - and this stunning apartment shows why. Desirably positioned on the heritage frontage so that period character complements contemporary quality, these sensational spaces are preceded by a luxuriously large courtyard that's ideal for entertaining. The inside story is similarly stylish with refined living and dining spaces that enjoy the dappled light from the leafy streetscape, and appreciate sunsets and city views. An open plan kitchen featuring stone benches, an integrated wine rack and excellent storage adds to the allure of a large single level floorplan with two generous bedrooms and luxurious bathroom with walk in rainforest shower. Storage cage and secure parking for two cars. Superb.
