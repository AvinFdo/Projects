Abbotsford-vic-3067,93 Nicholson Street Abbotsford VIC 3067,"Distinguished by superb design
The innovative, imaginative approach for which Interlandi Mantesso Architects are so highly regarded is immediately evident throughout this sophisticated c2017 townhouse - a residence that's equally distinctive in terms of its external lines and its internal dimensions. Beyond unique aesthetic first impressions and an elevated entrance, a living/dining area framed by 4.2m ceilings and polished concrete floors is complemented by an open-plan kitchen where the beauty of black stone bench-tops enhances the visual impact of sparkling stainless steel appliances. A downstairs bedroom featuring heating/cooling, built-in robes and its own bathroom is matched upstairs by a similarly seductive second bedroom also accompanied by an exceptional ensuite and built-in robes. Secure parking for two cars ensures the style of the design is matched by total convenience in a location that puts great cafes, the Yarra Trail, the Victoria Street vibe, trams and trains to the CBD all within moments' walk.

It's not often that a true renovator's delight comes along and it is even more desirable when it is situated on an unusually wide frontage in a great Abbotsford location - on the edge of the Yarra parklands and trails, moments from The Convent or Collingwood Station plus quick access to the CBD or the vibrant Victoria Street shops, cafes and restaurants; all underpinning its capital appreciation prospects. This single-fronted, freestanding Edwardian Cottage offers a unique restoration opportunity, which renovators will want to grab with open arms to restore it to its former glory.

Abbotsford-vic-3067,198 Gipps Street Abbotsford VIC 3067,"Rare Renovation or Redevelopment Opportunity
It's not often that a true renovator's delight comes along and it is even more desirable when it is situated on an unusually wide frontage in a great Abbotsford location - on the edge of the Yarra parklands and trails, moments from The Convent or Collingwood Station plus quick access to the CBD or the vibrant Victoria Street shops, cafes and restaurants; all underpinning its capital appreciation prospects. This single-fronted, freestanding Edwardian Cottage offers a unique restoration opportunity, which renovators will want to grab with open arms to restore it to its former glory. The north-facing allotment offers enticing options to extend out and up if desired; make use of approved plans to develop two, two storey residences on the site or renovate existing house to your own design, the choice is yours.
The existing house has some period features remaining including an arched hallway flanking two good sized bedrooms and leading to a full-width living room plus a modern kitchen/meals. To the rear there is a laundry and bathroom leading to a courtyard garden with storage shed and WC. Other features include R/C air conditioner (living), rear lane access and front off-street parking.
'Approved plans, permits and drawings are available on request'.","SOLD - $1,300,000","2

Ideally situated between the Yarra River and the cultural vibrancy and convenience of Victoria Street, this wonderfully modern apartment is the perfect combination of luxury city-edge living and urban oasis.
Fantastic timber flooring features throughout the open plan living and dining area, providing the perfect canvas to compose your dream space. The thoughtfully designed kitchen boasts smart storage, marble style splashback, stone bench-tops and quality appliances. The absolute highlight is the north-facing full-length balcony providing beautiful green vistas across the treetops of the adjacent Andrew's Reserve and Yarra Boulevard.
An oversized master bedroom showcases a private ensuite, built in robes and a dedicated study nook. The stunning central bathroom features floor to roof tiling, with elegant fittings and fixtures.

Moments from Victoria Gardens Shopping Centre, Yarra Bend hiking and bike trails, famed restaurants & shops of Victoria Street, and the cultural hubs of Richmond and Collingwood; whilst trams, trains and all of the inner city conveniences expected are a just a short stroll away.

Wake to the chorus of Bellbirds, and the chatter of red dumped parrots & rainbow lorikeets when the eucalyptus are flowering. Watch the black cormorants & the white faced herons in the river as well as pacific ducks and seagulls. When it has been raining, watch the slalom canoeists trying their skills on the rapids below Dights Falls. Be awe-struck at the unimpeded view across the tree tops to the magnificent sunrises and, occasionally the sky dotted with hot air balloons - Simply stunning!
An attractive, low maintenance lifestyle awaits with a premier position opposite the rejuvenated Victoria Park and moments from transport, the CBD, Smith Street and Brunswick Street's shops, cafes and restaurants as well as the Abbotsford Convent.

Abbotsford-vic-3067,136 Charles Street Abbotsford VIC 3067,"The ideal inner city scenario
The timelessly, traditionally appealing image of this single fronted Victorian fits perfectly into the period streetscape of an Abbotsford address widely regarded as the area's finest, consistently sought after for its proximity to great cafes, Collingwood station, the Victoria Street precinct and access to Yarra Bend Park. Two double bedrooms, each including built in robes and an open fire-place beneath their classical high ceilings, line the elegant arched hall leading to living and dining areas that convey the enduring character and complete comfort of previous renovation. A galley style kitchen zone performs with the modern efficiency that also defines the sky-lit bathroom while a study featuring access to a generous brick paved courtyard further enhances a home offering instant inner city appeal. Options for updating and extending when the mood or the moment are right, STCA, ensure the future prospects are as attractive as the present day profile.","SOLD - $1,220,000","2

The light, warmth and energy efficiency of an entirely north facing two bedroom apartment is rarely on offer, seldom is this coupled with views to a horizon of parklands. This first impression is immediately attractive but only once you have strolled through the community atmosphere of 'The Precinct' can you fully appreciate the full benefit of premium apartment living. A short walk past the secure entry with camera and intercom through appealing outdoor communal areas provides easy access to the city via public transport and bike paths. Miele appliances and distinctive lighting are the hallmarks of a luxurious kitchen while a central bathroom features quality finishes, walk in shower and stylish charcoal tiles. Serviced by onsite security, building manager and childcare, clever storage, gym, indoor lap pool and secure lock up storage this is truly the ultimate lifestyle proposition adjacent to the Yarra River, Victoria Gardens shopping centre and the vibrancy that defines Victoria Street.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"2

Abbotsford-vic-3067,93 Nicholson Street Abbotsford VIC 3067,"Distinguished by superb design
The innovative, imaginative approach for which Interlandi Mantesso Architects are so highly regarded is immediately evident throughout this sophisticated c2017 townhouse - a residence that's equally distinctive in terms of its external lines and its internal dimensions. Beyond unique aesthetic first impressions and an elevated entrance, a living/dining area framed by 4.2m ceilings and polished concrete floors is complemented by an open-plan kitchen where the beauty of black stone bench-tops enhances the visual impact of sparkling stainless steel appliances. A downstairs bedroom featuring heating/cooling, built-in robes and its own bathroom is matched upstairs by a similarly seductive second bedroom also accompanied by an exceptional ensuite and built-in robes. Secure parking for two cars ensures the style of the design is matched by total convenience in a location that puts great cafes, the Yarra Trail, the Victoria Street vibe, trams and trains to the CBD all within moments' walk.","SOLD - $820,000","2

Abbotsford-vic-3067,10A James Street Abbotsford VIC 3067,"Vacant land means pure potential
A vacant, level allotment, always a rarity in the inner city environs, conveys pure potential for creating a brand new residence tailored specifically to meet your own desires and demands. This block provides a perfect example of 'blank canvas' possibilities in a location offering immediate proximity to all the energy, cafes, retail and tram routes of Victoria Street. Such a setting, further enhanced by cul-de-sac exclusivity, ensures lifestyle enjoyment or investment success will accompany the property that's decided upon to grace these tempting dimensions. North Richmond station, the streetscape of East Melbourne and the freedom to walk to work through Fitzroy Gardens add to the attraction of this opportunity - where some 120m2 represents scope on a rewarding inner city scale. Capture the land, seize the moment, define the future - exactly as you envisage it.","SOLD - $691,000",120m²,Vacant land,Listing sold by advertiser 9th December 2017,"10A James Street, Abbotsford VIC 3067 was last sold in 2017.","ALL

Abbotsford-vic-3067,11 Bath Street Abbotsford VIC 3067,"Appreciate Abbotsford's best address
The beauty of this Hawthorn brick Victorian on blue stone foundations, which would be significant anywhere, is hugely enhanced by the unique lifestyle appeal of its setting on Abbotsford's most exclusive street overlooking the evocative environs of Victoria Park. Transformed from an iconic VFL venue to a fabulous community asset, the park complements a home accompanied by an allotment offering exceptional depth and second frontage to Trenerry Crescent. Two generous double bedrooms lead along a classical arched hall to central sitting and dining rooms where bright light from French doors to a north facing courtyard shines on freshly polished Baltic floorboards. A separate, stylishly updated kitchen defined by slate floors flows to a flexible additional living area and beyond to a lush, leafy rear courtyard. The modern bathroom completes a home last sold 30 years ago, poised to provide instant enjoyment, and further potential, close to the Convent precinct and the Capital City Trail.","SOLD - $1,456,000","2

Maybe morning sunshine would be nice...
I think that is all...perhaps parks and a golf course""

Abbotsford-vic-3067,60 Charles Street Abbotsford VIC 3067,"Expanded, extended, exceptional
The perennial appeal of this semi-detached, three bedroom Victorian has been impressively enhanced by the significant extension of its inviting spaces. The result creates an exceptional balance of period elegance and modern excellence close to great local cafes, the vibrancy of Victoria Street and trams to the city centre. A traditional arched hall and two front bedrooms, each featuring an open fireplace and original Baltic pine floorboards, lead to a fresh, effectively sky-lit bathroom. A third bedroom to the rear enjoys an attractive outdoor aspect and completes the accommodation of a home where generous living and dining areas are framed front and rear by French doors. Granite benches and great storage define an open plan kitchen complemented by a walk-in pantry while beyond the interior spaces a brick paved courtyard, with a decked entertaining space, offers attractive proportions and appealing privacy. A city edge address that will always be in demand.","SOLD - $1,370,000","3

Abbotsford-vic-3067,208/1 Turner Street Abbotsford VIC 3067,"An Inner-City Haven
If lifestyle and location are important to you, then you’re going to love this brilliant inner-city apartment, enjoying a prized position with everything at your fingertips, just a stone’s throw from Victoria Park and trendy cafes on Johnston Street.
The floorplan showcases an open and airy living room and dining area, accompanied by a well-appointed kitchen equipped with stone benchtops, modern subway tiles, crisp high gloss cabinetry and quality appliances, extending onto a balcony providing a relaxing place to enjoy a glass of wine as you watch the sun go down or a lazy weekend BBQ with friends.

It is superbly appointed with split system air-conditioning, laminate flooring, carpeted bedrooms, Euro style laundry, a secure car space and a storage cage.
Situated in an unrivalled location, it’s footsteps from Victoria Park train station, bus services, moments to Collingwood Children’s Farm, Yarra Bend Park, a host of cycling and walking trails, the Yarra River and it’s exceptionally close to the Eastern Freeway and the city for those who commute each day.","SOLD - $602,000","2

Abbotsford-vic-3067,420/88 Trenerry Crescent Abbotsford VIC 3067,"Abbotsford at its absolute best
Converted from the industrial era origins that defined the Yarra Falls precinct in a manner that acknowledges the past, the design flair of Carabott Holt Turcinov Architects has taken this evocative former textile mill building into the future beautifully. An impressive foyer and landscaped environs including the impressively preserved chimney stack complement this inviting fourth floor apartment's spaces - including a living/dining area featuring bamboo floors and a kitchen equipped with stone benches and Gaggenau appliances. The accompanying balcony brings in bright morning light, enhancing a floorplan offering a main bedroom with ensuite, a central second bedroom and a stylish main bathroom. A flexible study zone is an added element of these engaging proportions, complemented by security, an allocated car space and a dedicated cage in a secure store room. Directly opposite the vibrant community asset that Victoria Park has become, close to the river and trains to the city.","SOLD - $655,000","2

Abbotsford-vic-3067,91-93 Charles Street Abbotsford VIC 3067,"Just Picture the Possibilities!
Tantalizingly close to the cool cafes of Victoria St, Collingwood Station and the Convent arts precinct, experience cosmopolitan inner-city living at its best with the Yarra River on your doorstep and the added appeal of a wide tree-lined street with the history of Abbotsford seemingly distilled into its DNA. Presenting a near perfect platform for the `hands-on' market inspired by The Block, this spacious and solidly built 4BR home on a bumper 256sqm (approx.) double block is positively plump with potential for buyers ready to roll up their sleeves.
Designed over two levels with obvious scope for self-contained in-law/teenage accommodation, the home is presented for sale in immaculate original condition, very livable as it stands and now ready for the next chapter in its story to unfold. The ground floor currently provides a versatile 4.2m x 6.5m (approx.) living area with separate basic kitchen and bathroom/laundry adjacent, while the entry foyer also provides convenient internal access to the garage. It's not hard to see the fabulous scope on this level to create a self-contained studio perfect for keeping loved ones close in their golden years or perhaps a fun kids' rumpus/games zone to call their own.
Upstairs, the large living and dining room opens to the front balcony, while a dramatic archway links the adjacent open-plan kitchen/meals zone. A model of efficiency that will respond beautifully to modern makeover, the existing kitchen has a wall oven and cook top and loads of cupboard storage. Accommodation is by way of up to four bedrooms (or three plus a study)
attended by the family bathroom, separate toilet and laundry.
In easy reach of the Collingwood Children's Farm, the farmer's market, Bridge Rd and Swan Street shopping, extras here include air conditioning, under stair storage area, low maintenance surrounds and a double garage.

Abbotsford-vic-3067,47 Studley Street Abbotsford VIC 3067,"Inner city desirability defined
The attractions and activities we associate with the term 'inner city lifestyle' are made irresistibly available by this captivating Victorian where the Abbotsford Convent precinct, Collingwood Children's Farm, bike paths running by the river and Collingwood station are just some of the elements that complement the character and the comfort of its spaces. Two double bedrooms, each with its own reverse cycle heating/cooling, project an appeal that's immediately matched by the profile of a central living room defined by a welcoming mood and a period fireplace. A separate kitchen/dining area that offers ample space for a second living zone features polished floors, its own heating/cooling, a cellar and a welcoming link to a rear deck where bistro blinds and a courtyard with right-of-way add to the outdoor appeal. Excellent storage throughout. Capture a beautiful example of a quintessential Victorian design around the corner from Gahan Reserve - and enjoy all its inner city attributes.","SOLD - $1,180,000","2

Abbotsford-vic-3067,217 Langridge Street Abbotsford VIC 3067,"Excellence matches elegance
A streetscape that adds leafy appeal to a location of total convenience complements the flexible, light filled spaces of this inviting residence, a home that delivers exactly what we seek from an inner city address. The northern light and freshly polished floorboards of a fabulous living room lead to separate dimensions for dining accompanied by a well appointed kitchen and beyond to the low maintenance privacy of a rear courtyard. Upstairs, the sunny, spacious main bedroom featuring a charming balcony, built in robes and spa bath ensuite is matched by the modern proportions of two additional bedrooms, each with built in robes, that surround a central study zone and a sky lit, family sized bathroom. Heating, cooling, Foxtel connectivity and ample storage further enhance a home featuring a versatile office, retreat or play room, easily returned to original role as a secure garage, enjoying city access, North Richmond station and Victoria Street's trams, shopping and restaurants.","SOLD - $1,000,000","3

Abbotsford-vic-3067,Abbotsford VIC 3067,"ABBOTSFORD AT ITS BEST - CHARACTER & CHARM
Boasting more than just a great suburb to reside in, this piece of
Melbourne's historic past is loaded with original features and
charm. It's like stepping back in time - a street lined with
single-fronted homes, blue-stone gutters, picket fences and scattered
parks make this a wonderful place to call home.
A three bedroom property with open fire places, polished floorboards,
high ceilings, exposed brick walls and a north facing back garden capture a century of historical architecture combined with renovated features.
From the front entrance a single hallway takes you on a journey past
two bedrooms (main with open fire place) through to a central
renovated bathroom, sunken lounge (with open fire place) opening out
to the kitchen and a second north facing living area which looks out
across the back garden. Sculptured recycled steel and timber finishes
enhance an already superbly restored family home.
A single timber stair case leads from the kitchen / dining area to a
second level which opens out into a third good size bedroom with
second bathroom and separate bath. Access to a roof top terrace is via the second level along a unique bridge style walkway. All
this can only be experienced through a private inspection.
Additional features include:
Hydronic heating
Newly renovated central bathroom
North facing roof top terrace
Attic storage area
Close to Abbotsford Convent, Victoria Park train station and Hoddle St buses

Abbotsford-vic-3067,69 Studley Street Abbotsford VIC 3067,"The essence of inner city style
A contemporary vitality complements the classical appeal of this inner city Victorian, a home that epitomizes the attraction of living close to cafes, the Abbotsford Convent, Collingwood Children's Farm and trains to the CBD from Collingwood station. Period traditions, projected by the charming façade and an arched hall, introduce a light filled north facing front bedroom with an open fire place and a second, equally inviting double bedroom featuring built in robes. The renovated central bathroom's designer flair enhances the comfort of the accommodation in a distinctively desirably way. A living room rich in character, with reverse cycle heating/cooling, precedes a separate kitchen/dining space that's just completed, impressively appointed and yet to be used while beyond, the landscaped courtyard's leafy privacy, olive trees and seating with storage are accompanied by off street parking access via rear right-of-way - a significant advantage in such a great city edge setting.","SOLD - $1,121,000","2

Abbotsford-vic-3067,114/56 Nicholson Street Abbotsford VIC 3067,"Denton Mills at its most desirable
Acknowledged as one of William Pitt's distinguished designs, the c1880s Denton Mills were pivotal not only to the industrial growth of Abbotsford but also to the emergence of 'Marvellous Melbourne'. This landmark has, since 2008, gained equally significant status as an inner city residential address - and this stunning apartment shows why. Desirably positioned on the heritage frontage so that period character complements contemporary quality, these sensational spaces are preceded by a luxuriously large courtyard that's ideal for entertaining. The inside story is similarly stylish with refined living and dining spaces that enjoy the dappled light from the leafy streetscape, and appreciate sunsets and city views. An open plan kitchen featuring stone benches, an integrated wine rack and excellent storage adds to the allure of a large single level floorplan with two generous bedrooms and luxurious bathroom with walk in rainforest shower. Storage cage and secure parking for two cars. Superb.","SOLD - $840,000","2

Abbotsford-vic-3067,69 Studley Street Abbotsford VIC 3067,"The essence of inner city style
A contemporary vitality complements the classical appeal of this inner city Victorian, a home that epitomizes the attraction of living close to cafes, the Abbotsford Convent, Collingwood Children's Farm and trains to the CBD from Collingwood station. Period traditions, projected by the charming façade and an arched hall, introduce a light filled north facing front bedroom with an open fire place and a second, equally inviting double bedroom featuring built in robes. The renovated central bathroom's designer flair enhances the comfort of the accommodation in a distinctively desirably way. A living room rich in character, with reverse cycle heating/cooling, precedes a separate kitchen/dining space that's just completed, impressively appointed and yet to be used while beyond, the landscaped courtyard's leafy privacy, olive trees and seating with storage are accompanied by off street parking access via rear right-of-way - a significant advantage in such a great city edge setting.","SOLD - $1,121,000","2

Abbotsford-vic-3067,114/56 Nicholson Street Abbotsford VIC 3067,"Denton Mills at its most desirable
Acknowledged as one of William Pitt's distinguished designs, the c1880s Denton Mills were pivotal not only to the industrial growth of Abbotsford but also to the emergence of 'Marvellous Melbourne'. This landmark has, since 2008, gained equally significant status as an inner city residential address - and this stunning apartment shows why. Desirably positioned on the heritage frontage so that period character complements contemporary quality, these sensational spaces are preceded by a luxuriously large courtyard that's ideal for entertaining. The inside story is similarly stylish with refined living and dining spaces that enjoy the dappled light from the leafy streetscape, and appreciate sunsets and city views. An open plan kitchen featuring stone benches, an integrated wine rack and excellent storage adds to the allure of a large single level floorplan with two generous bedrooms and luxurious bathroom with walk in rainforest shower. Storage cage and secure parking for two cars. Superb.","SOLD - $840,000","2

Abbotsford-vic-3067,144 Vere Street Abbotsford VIC 3067,"The allure of a great address
The reasons for this enticing, Victorian being held in the same hands for over 26 years are explained by its immense appeal of period charm and surprising space, also the attraction of an address that has long been one of Abbotsford's most highly regarded, tightly held locations. The particular allure of its prime position fronting Gahan Reserve's parkland gives ""Coromandel"" exceptional status, ensuring a charming outlook over green expanses greets the bay window of a romantic main bedroom, further enhanced by an open fireplace and built in robes. Leafy aspects through French doors accompany a generous second bedroom and superb living and dining areas that include an open plan kitchen concluding with a lush north facing rear courtyard of perfect privacy. A huge central spa bathroom serves a design easily expanded to three bedrooms if desired on a block offering exceptional width. Heating/cooling, Baltic floors, lead light windows, indoor bicycle storage add desirable detail to an irresistible inner city home.","SOLD - $1,100,000","2
