clyde-vic-3978,1410 Ballarto Road CLYDE VIC 3978,"**UNDER OFFER / UNDER CONTRACT BY PAUL RINGERI**
CLYDE (115703263): If you have been looking for a tree change, a place where you can simply move in, unpack and relax with nothing to do then I suggest you add 1410 Ballarto Road to your inspection list!
Surrounded by well manicured landscaped gardens and sprawling neighbouring acreage this is a true lifestyle property in every sense of the word. Ideally suited to growing families and those downsizing from larger property there is plenty of room for the horses to roam around and enough space for the kids to ride the 4-wheeler!
Loved and cared for over the years the current owners have left no stone unturned in creating one of most appealing properties within this private township.
The home itself is ranch style in design and is full of character and charm. Offering 3 spacious robed bedrooms plus an enclosed study with double doors. The master suite provides a ceiling fan, bonus robe space plus a FES with 1.5 shower. Bedrooms 2 and 3 are in close proximity to the family toilet and bathroom with separate shower and corner spa bath. The enclosed study can easily be utilised as a 4th bedroom.
The hostess timber kitchen is a chef's dream! With a picturesque outlook there is an abundance of cupboard/bench space and appliances including a wall oven, rangehood, dishwasher and 4-burner hot plate. All this plus a whole lot more including the wide fridge cavity and a microwave provision overlooking the separate meals area with convenient external sliding door access.
There are 3 separate living zones catering for all forms of entertaining. Upon entry you will be greeted by a formal lounge with bay window which, given that it can be enclosed using the sliding door and feature bi-fold door, would make the ideal home theatre room. The separate family area is complete with a visually impacting timber lined vaulted ceiling plus a brick feature wall and gas converted Coonara. The oversized tiled rumpus/games room offers feature lighting, RC/SS air-conditioning, built in wall unit plus a hostess bar offering hot/cold water facilities. This is the perfect place for the pool table and darts board. Given that it can be shut off from the main residence and has separate side access it can easily double up as the perfect office for running a home based business (S.T.C.A.).
Added internal extras include a private entry, Tasmanian Oak timber flooring, walk in linen storage, laundry with ironing bench facilities plus a state of the art monitored alarm system (house and garage can be activated separately). Don't forget the cornice work, federation colours, downlights, feature walls, quality blinds, near new evaporative cooling, ducted heating plus ducted vacuuming.
Step outside and be greeted by a sweeping driveway with a 360 degree turning circle. Picturesque landscaping creates the perfect street scape whilst the private front yard is easily distinguished from the oversized front fenced paddock. Kick back and enjoy the vista views from the extensive under-roofline verandah. There is a second fenced paddock at the rear plus a spacious back yard which is also aesthetically pleasing given the natural rural landscape.
If you like outdoor entertaining then your wish is my command! Relax with a glass of your finest whilst enjoying a family BBQ under the decked pergola. Measuring app. 7m x 11m and complete with a ceiling fan this is the place to be during the Summer months!
If you require substantial garage, parking and storage space then you are bound to have all of your boxes ticked. There is a concreted bay with sufficient space for app. 7 large vehicles and a huge concreted shed with power, lighting and side walkway access. Measuring app. 18m X 8m X 4.2m with remote roller door there is comfortable undercover parking for 6 cars. Don't forget the rear shed, more suited for storage, measuring app. 7m x 6m.
Bonus external features include an enclosed dog pen and colourbond roofing!
Within a short drive to freeway access and all amenities located in the townships of Berwick, Clyde, Junction Village and Cranbourne. This dream property is also only minutes away from the popular Clyde Primary School, the newly constructed Casey Fields football ground and aquatic centre, the Royal Botanic Gardens and the Cranbourne Race Track.
If you want your family to have the very best in country living within minutes to all of the amenities associated with city living including entertainment, education and recreation then enquire today before it's SELLING .. SELLING ... SOLD!

clyde-vic-3978,28 Railway Road CLYDE VIC 3978,"Endless opportunities on almost a 1/3 Acre
This is an amazing opportunity to secure an impressive investment in the future. Located in the tightly held township of Clyde where an old fashioned sense of space and a real feel of community still exist. With a huge amount of parkland across the road for the kids to stretch their legs chasing the dog or playing a spot of footy, and all just a short walk to the general store and primary school, life cant get much better than this! The home itself has a great family orientated layout with multiple living zones downstairs and an open light filled kitchen with loads of cupboard and bench space. The upstairs sleeping accommodation consists of three generous sized bedrooms with the master featuring ensuite and a further bathroom to cater to the balance of the bedrooms. The home is the perfect home to revitalize or redesign with endless possibilities for extensions or to put your own stamp on it. Outdoors, the options just continue to expand with an external self-contained single bedroom cottage and a good sized shed that makes for a multitude of uses. Thinking about all this its not just an investment in the future but a great lifestyle for today....
