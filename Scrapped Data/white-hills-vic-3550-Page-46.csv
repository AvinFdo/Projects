white-hills-vic-3550,294 Guys Hill Road Strathfieldsaye VIC 3551,"Location a prize plus enviable size
It's not surprising Strathfieldsaye continues to appeal, offering a peaceful country lifestyle focussed on families and a strong sense of community. Coupled with numerous local conveniences, it's also merely 7.5 kilometres from comprehensive amenities in central Bendigo. However, this property has many more particularly attractive attributes to tempt city-dwellers slightly further afield to its enviable address.
Firstly, at 1050m2 (approximately), the dream of owning quarter acre in a terrific location can now be realised. Set back from the road by a 40 metre driveway allowance enhances privacy and greatly reduces traffic noise. At 5 metres wide, it could perhaps even accommodate dual lanes!
Prospects of building within a fairly square site measuring 26x31 metres enables extensive variety of prospective floorplans. Mature gum trees from bordering neighbours borrow a superb backdrop for future landscaping and outdoor living, plus pleasant views from indoors. Saving costs, some boundaries are already fenced, and all services are readily available to the block.
Dinner and drinks at Braidie's Tavern are well within staggering distance and Greater Bendigo National Park is just a few paddocks away! Other local amenities include pre and primary schools plus bowls club is a 6 minute cycle or 18 walk, with football and netball club even closer. An extra 200 metres puts shops and supermarket on the list. La Trobe uni is an 18 minute bus or bike ride from here, add 6 to reach central Bendigo by the same means, or drive the 7.5 kilometres in under 10 minutes.
So, what's not to love?","SOLD - $180,000","1,050m²",Vacant land,Sold by private treaty 27 Jul 2020,"294 Guys Hill Road, Strathfieldsaye VIC 3551 was last sold in 2020.","ALL
