This positively geared bargain basement new townhouse is the perfect addition to your investment portfolio. It is currently rented for $280 per week on a secure 12 month lease and represents a gain of about $60 per week if you take an interest only loan at 5%! If you can find a better low risk investment anywhere else I’d suggest you snap it up, because at this price and return this one surely won’t last.
It has 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, small secure yard and single carport, central heating, split system, stainless appliances and is a great compact, low maintenance townhouse. Oh and if you are looking for and extra sweetener you can claim all the depreciation allowances as it is under 2 months old! Even your accountant won’t believe how good the numbers stack up.
