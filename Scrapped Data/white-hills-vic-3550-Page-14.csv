white-hills-vic-3550,156 St Killian Street White Hills VIC 3550,"Country charm - minutes to CBD
This picture-perfect property is bound for adoration by another happy family. Though only minutes from schools, shopping and Botanical gardens the setting possesses sweet serenity of a bushland retreat. Set on approximately 1500m2, neighbouring homes can barely be seen past gorgeous gardens, vast lawns and tall gums on this corner block. Double French glass doors in both living zones lead out to a broad bull-nose return verandah that includes a parents retreat right outside the master. High-gloss hardwood timber floors flow beneath 9' ceilings with ornamental cornice.
This house is all about a beautiful ambiance, where treating yourself to an open fire in winter and beautiful spring breeze comes naturally. Warm or cool breezes circulated by ceiling fans add to split system air conditioning and join ducted heating for supreme comfort. Recently restored Blackwood benchtops in the kitchen along with modern elements such as stainless steel appliances and subway splashback tiles contrast against exquisite timbers to impressive effect. Fully renovated family bathroom incorporates abundant storage, as does the fully renovated laundry and 2 bedrooms that have built-in robes. The study would make an ideal nursery, positioned opposite the main bedroom that has walk-in robe plus ensuite with 1200mm shower. With shed connected to power and concrete base, pergola with barbeque on natural gas, carport and cubby-cottage plus swing-set, this utterly enticing family package is complete.","SOLD - $398,000","3

white-hills-vic-3550,469 Napier Street White Hills VIC 3550,"Art-Deco Gem Provides Plenty Of Opportunity
Located in an easily accessible location; walking distance to shops, bus stops, schools and amenities, this solid red brick home is full of possibility.
Situated on a corner allotment, this character-filled property offers a gravel drive and established front garden at the front of the house and also allows access for vehicles from the quiet side street.
Built in 1950, the home retains many of it’s original features including art deco style ceiling roses and fireplace surround, pelmets, double hung windows, timber flooring and cabinetry, picture railings and so much more.
Leading in through the formal entry you have access to the large living room, filled with authentic art deco detail. A solid fuel fire and air conditioner in this room is also accompanied by ducted gas heating throughout the property.
On the other side of the hall is the spacious dining room, with ceiling fan, leading through a sliding door to an updated kitchen. The light and bright kitchen provides a sympathetic refurbishment complementing the retained original features including wood fire oven and surrounds. The addition of contemporary fittings such as dishwasher, electric oven and gas cooktop along with ample built-in storage provide a practical and charming space.
Through a backdoor in the kitchen you have access to a rear deck and al fresco space. A lawn area leads around to a generous yard at the side of the property. Access to the backyard is provided from both the front of the house and also via double gates from the quiet side street, allowing a drive-in approach to the rear garden.
Off the back deck is a large outhouse with fittings, sink and cabinetry for a laundry, however this could also make a great studio or extra outdoor storage space.
Back inside and through the kitchen to the main hall you will find a large utility room that also leads out to the rear deck. This ideally positioned space offers lots of potential and could be easily be used as an indoor laundry room, or provides the opportunity to extend the kitchen and create a second dining area or a neat butler’s pantry.
Further along the hallway there is additional built-in storage, and then a large original bathroom, complete with a fantastic freestanding vanity. Extra storage space has been added without taking away from the authentic detail. A separate toilet completes the bathroom space.
Towards the end of the hallway you will find two large bedrooms, both with ceiling fans, and then access to the master suite at the end of the property.
The spacious master has air conditioning, separate access from the front of the home, and can also be completely divided from the rest of the property with a heavy, lockable door, if required. This provides great potential for alternative uses to the space – such as creating a separate studio or an office for someone working from home and wanting an independent workspace.
An additional room to the rear of the master is ripe for renovation and could be ideal as an additional, private living space, robe area or storage room.
This charming property offers the buyer a fantastic opportunity to create a beautiful home; a fantastic business in a great location; or a potential rental investment prospect. The choice is yours!","SOLD - $270,000","3

white-hills-vic-3550,14 Arbor Place White Hills VIC 3550,"Contemporary, Easy Care Elegance In A Quiet Locale
Privately tucked away in a quiet cul-de-sac that is part of a pristine boutique estate, this impeccable home is only minutes drive from both the White Hills Botanical Gardens and Lake Weeroona.
This lovely contemporary home delivers an ideal environment for young professionals, families or retirees scaling down seeking low maintenance living. The double garage provides additional length with shelving and room for a workshop, and the space offers access to both the house and the backyard.
The large master bedroom has a walk-in-robe with a spacious ensuite, complete with double vanity. The entrance hallway has additional built-in cupboard space and leads to the open plan kitchen, dining and living space. Every detail in the kitchen has been considered including a generous island bench, glass splashback, loads of storage, a brand new Bosch dishwasher, space for a double fridge and an electric oven with gas cooktop.
Off the kitchen is a child’s retreat or second living space that would make an ideal library or home office. This opens off to an secondary zone offering two bedrooms (complete with built-in robes); a sparkling family bathroom; separate toilet and a good sized laundry with a sliding door to the rear yard; graveled service area; garden shed and clothesline.
Sliding doors from both the living and dining space ensure this area provides beautiful natural light throughout the entire day. The aspect from the main room really provides wow factor and encourages indoor-outdoor living. The L-shaped Merbau deck is complimented by the small (Sir Walter) grassed area and established courtyard hedge.
The west of the house has new awnings on all the external windows to keep the home naturally cool on warm days.
Added details throughout – such as the custom-made Needlecraft blinds and unique light fittings – add to the feeling of class that this modern property exudes.
Beautifully presented, this attractive home will immediately impress.","SOLD - $380,000","3
