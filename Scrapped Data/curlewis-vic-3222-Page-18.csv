My vendor's plans have changed but they were drawn to the feature of living over the road from a kid's playground a new estate and a new start, which is soon to have a new shopping complex and only 20 minutes from the city of Geelong is this block of land in Curlewis. Wide frontage wide range of plan options.
I have taken the liberty of making your decision easier by approaching a local builder to make some suggestions of some plans that will suit the land. These plans are attached.
If you want to design your own layout or already have a builder in mind no problem, this land and its location is looking for someone to help complete the landscape of the street. If I was kid I would thoroughly enjoy playing on this playground.
Have a wander on the land take your mind to living in your new home with new surroundings.","SOLD - $174,000",576m²,Vacant land,Sold by private treaty 25 Nov 2014,0,"ALL

curlewis-vic-3222,8 Kelpie Boulevard CURLEWIS VIC 3222,"Best Priced Block On The Street
The owners have decided that building is not for them and would like to secure an established home which has lead to the sale of this magnificent block. 8 Kelpie Boulevard is situated in the new Coriyule Estate which is close to schools, shops & the boat ramp. A new shopping complex in Curlewis is also due to commence in the near future. My vendors have said that the location is what attracted them to the area in the first place with easy access to Geelong & The Surf Coast. Excellent growth has been predicted in the area over the next few years so all you have to do is decide if you would prefer to secure at today's prices.

curlewis-vic-3222,10 Baybrook Avenue Curlewis VIC 3222,"Brand new high spec coastal home
My first impressions walking through this home are ""wow what a modern look"", walking through a sense of natural light is evident immediately through the large entry and particularly the north facing living room, cleverly designed with cathedral style ceiling allowing for maximum sunlight throughout the day.
On the rare occasion a builder will design the house around the block not the other way... The feeling this home gives touring can only be expressed in person - an inspection is a must.
Features include:
- 3 bedrooms
- Master with walk in robe & ensuite
- Kitchen with 40mm stone bench & s/s appliances, inc dishwasher
- Reverse cycle heating & cooling
- Large north facing living
- Double garage with internal access
- Plenty of space north facing yard
Curlewis Parks designed for those seeking more than just convenience but a sensational Bayside lifestyle, with access to Geelong an easy drive, however Drysdale offering so much and expanding further there will be less reasons to have to leave.
