curlewis-vic-3222,82-90 Swan Bay Road Wallington VIC 3222,"Enviable Rural Lifestyle Close to the Coast
Contact the listing agent to arrange a private inspection.
Set back from Swan Bay Road in a quiet pocket of rural tranquillity - and just a few minutes drive from spectacular coastal surf beaches - this smart, contemporary home on just over 5 acres offers a truly enviable lifestyle.
As you drive through the solar-powered front security gate, you pass a mature and fully-productive olive grove, a fabulous range of fruit trees, and a careful selection of established trees that have been retained to provide ideal shade around the property.
In traditional Australian style, the homestead sports a north-facing front verandah, a west-facing paved pergola, and a south-facing deck that overlooks a sparkling swimming pool.
Inside, a relaxed lounge offers a delightful bay window with garden views, and a split-system for year-round comfort. The dining area has access to the deck, via a sliding door, and the galley-style kitchen, with its own butlers pantry, provides every amenity for creating fine cuisine. Theres a large Westinghouse electric oven and ceramic cooktop, a Bosch dishwasher, stone bench tops, and loads of cupboard space and built-in shelving. The large deck is an obvious destination for alfresco dining and entertainment. Down a central hall are a laundry, an ultra-modern bathroom, three bedrooms with built-in robes and ceiling fans, and a master bedroom with a walk-through robe, and an ensuite. Electric heating from the slab keeps everything toasty during the cooler months.
The property is divided into 3 paddocks, all with rabbit-proof fencing, and the three sheds all have electric power - plus the large 5-bay Workshop/Machinery shed also has water and two roller doors.
Other features of interest are fixed wireless NBN, a 22,500 litre water tank, a 140 sq.m. chicken run, and a 10 m. long raised veggie bed with mushroom compost. Plus the option of purchasing a 22.5 hp Massey Ferguson Tractor and attachments.
Inspection is highly recommended.","SOLD - $1,200,000","4
