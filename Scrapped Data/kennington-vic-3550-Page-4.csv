kennington-vic-3550,20 Hewitt Avenue Kennington VIC 3550,"A SURPRISE INSIDE!
Step back in time to this retro 1960's brick home, set on a sizeable allotment and located in a sought after neighbourhood of popular Kennington. Solid as a rock and packed full of character, the home oozes potential and offers so many different options for a discerning buyer to take advantage of. Only a few minutes to central Bendigo and convenient to local shops, schools and amenities, this little ripper would make a terrific first home, value add project or sound investment
Perched back from the road on the high side of the street, the home sits to one side of the large 846m2 (approx.) allotment. Featuring a split level floor plan that has been exceptionally well maintained through the years, so many options are available to renovate, modernise, extend, or live/rent comfortably as it is. Many original features remain, including beautiful big timber windows allowing loads of natural light, stunning hardwood floors, slate tile feature wall, timber book shelves, wood heater and high ceilings with exposed beams.
Three bedrooms provide accommodation, two are fitted with built in robes whilst the spacious master at the rear has its own small ensuite featuring shower and vanity, and views of the back yard. The main bathroom has been updated and boasts shower over bath, vanity and separate toilet. The open plan part of the home encompasses the kitchen, meals and lounge room, which is a delightful space to congregate. The kitchen is original but more than serviceable for the now until its time to update, whilst the meals space overlooks a sunken lounge room below. The lounge is awash with natural light thanks to the floor to ceiling windows along the front side and at one end is a funky slate feature wall that is a throwback to a bygone era!
Outside, the sizeable allotment offers plenty of scope for future ideas. As it stands, the private and secluded yard is established, with loads of room for pets, kids and a vegie garden to thrive. However, there is so much potential for future ideas including space for extending the home, a super outdoor entertaining area, or even a swimming pool down the track? There is a good sized shed in place that has concrete floor and power, and vehicle access to the rear yard through the carport and double gates at the front
So many options and so much potential here. All the ingredients of an astute real estate acquisition are here, including location and price point. So whatever the reason for your purchase, you will be suitably rewarded!","SOLD - $399,000","3

kennington-vic-3550,5 Primrose Court Kennington VIC 3550,"TAKE A STEP BACK TO THE 70'S - AND REAP THE REWARDS!
Positioned in the heart of Kennington and set amongst some lovely homes in popular Primrose Court is this almost untouched 1970's classic cream brick home on over 940m2 (approximately). It is almost a step back in time with its original kitchen and three colorful bathrooms, timber panelling and bright window furnishings. The best part is, it is in really good order and lends itself to a wonderful cosmetic makeover or just some minor trendy improvements to retain its retro styling.
The home boasts five bedrooms (all up-stairs); there is the main retreat with full en-suite and walk-in-robe; a second main bedroom with smaller robe and en-suite and three bedrooms with ample storage and size. The family bathroom is handy to the three smaller bedrooms and boasts original tiling, bath, vanity basin, shower and toilet.
On the ground level is a large carpeted lounge, separate formal dining room (would make a smaller TV room) and a large rumpus room with original built-in-bar overlooking the rear yard. Adjacent is the kitchen-meals space. The kitchen is also original, boasting large wall oven and grill, original dishwasher and original ceramic hotplates with ample cabinetry and views to the back yard.
Stairway is solid, there is plenty of storage and there's a powder room downstairs. The home boasts ducted HYDRONIC heating throughout.
There is a single lock-up garage and a second lock-up space for a workshop (or bikes/motorbike), to the side of the house is a wide driveway leading to a 7m x 9m Powered Brick Shed with a toilet - an ideal workshop or space to store your boat!! The bones are there, position is excellent... the home just needs a new owner with some time and TLC to bring it back to its grandeur of the 70's or the ""now"".","SOLD - $460,000","5

kennington-vic-3550,2 Ironbark Court Kennington VIC 3550,"Vendor Says ""Sell"": $430,000
Incredibly well maintained and immaculately presented, this home represents today's lifestyle in an elegant package. It is set on a low maintenance, 518m2 allotment in a very appealing residential location. Neighboured by other quality homes and picturesque surrounds.
The symmetry of two garage doors and two bay windows, the double front, the established gardens and the well proportioned verandah; all compliment the red brick home and combine to give it its attractive looks. Its internal beauty and elegance is immediately evident upon entering the home.
Stepping inside you will note the transition from the practical and beautiful floating timber floor underfoot marking the entry, to the warm plush carpet of the very generous and tasteful formal lounge and dining areas. Both are as blessed with natural sunlight and warmth as they are spacious and inviting. There is nothing snooty about the formality of the layout or the decor. Rather, you will feel an immediate sense of ease and incredible comfort.
Well placed doorways allow for zoned living and entertaining. The kitchen and second living area are open plan and also enjoy plenty of natural sunlight and warmth. Another bay window over the kitchen sink and glass sliding door to the living room look out to the rear verandah and north easterly terrace. It's a tranquil view of the floodlit palms of an evening.
What's most pleasing about offering this property to the market is how much it answers the needs of the market! Increasingly buyers are prioritising well constructed and thoughtfully designed homes, such as this. In enviable locations close to popular amenities and natural environs, such as this. As well as a decent study in addition to properly proportioned bedrooms, such as this.
Many speak of their desire for proper storage, low to no maintenance gardens and proper functionality in a floorplan. Here the storage is incredible, the gardens are designed to be almost indestructible (to allow you to simply enjoy entertaining and to take off for extended holidays without a care); and the floorplan is properly functional. The main things you'll love about this residence are:
- Generous main bedroom with ensuite and great wardrobes with dressing mirrors.
- Two further great sized bedrooms with large built in robes.
- Study with great built in cupboard.
- Oversized double automatic garage.

kennington-vic-3550,23 Yallambee Drive Kennington VIC 3550,"Hiding Heaps of Value
This seemingly humble 4 bedroom brick home hides a multitude of highly appealing attributes! Much larger than it looks, it also has the size and location to comfortably accommodate a thriving tribe. Although attractive enough in its current state, it offers opportunity for a cosmetic makeover to increase value and add a little contemporary edge.
Stainless steel appliances have already been updated in a kitchen centred between 2 huge living and dining areas. Dishwasher, electric wall oven and gas cooktop are prepared for mealtimes behind the breakfast bar. The inner climate is tempered by a combination of a wood fire, ducted heating and cooling, air conditioning, ceiling fan, outdoor awnings, pelmets and drapes. All 4 bedrooms are very generous and the main has ensuite.
An astonishing array of storage options include incredible bonuses that go far beyond the built-in his'n'hers robes. There's also a cavernous basement with windows and verandah, large storeroom, garden shed and enormous workshop for all your tools! The double garage has a bar alongside plenty of room to party, but if you need more the single carport can provide plus there is a barbie area under shade-sail. No doubt the red brick pizza ovens will be popular in the back garden too!
Nestled amongst a neighbourhood of amazing abodes, with a medical practice a few doors away, bus stops are around the corner. Stroll into the city for a Sunday latte in 30 minutes, less to Strath shopping, reservoir bushland reserve, parks and much less to schools.
A genuinely unique family package!","SOLD - $395,000","4

kennington-vic-3550,2/17 Claire Court Kennington VIC 3550,"Full Sized Home on Compact Block in Kennington
Idyllic' only begins to describe the location of this quality home. Towards the end of a quiet residential court and almost adjoining a recreational walkway to Mill Street, this home (along with its neighbours) knows the true meaning of house-proud street appeal.
Deceptively spacious, inside you will find three bedrooms with robes, and a generously proportioned bathroom space. The open plan living/meals area opens to the kitchen, which will cater for a family with ease. Ample bench space and cupboards, gas cooktop and a dishwasher complete the picture.
The home is serviced by ducted gas heating and ducted electric cooling, which is particularly useful on those hot and sticky summer days.
While the elevated block is a low maintenance 311m2, the landscaping is thoughtful and useful. Pedestrian access from the front yard on one side of the house, and from the single garage on the other, there is a small well-kept garden shed, tiered retaining garden beds and a grassy area that would be ample for small pets, young children or those who prefer low-maintenance gardening.
If you would like to walk, the All Seasons Resort on McIvor Road is less than 1km away, or if you head the other direction you'll find Kennington Reservoir, Woolworths, IGA, Aldi, and numerous specialty stores within walking distance.
The appeal of this home is truly universal. Perfect for retirees who are looking for high-quality, low-maintenance living, ideal for first home buyers or those looking to secure property in this sought-after suburb at an affordable price point, and appealing to investors who know there will be many tenants seeking a property like this.
