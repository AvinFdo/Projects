kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,200 Mackenzie Street West Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Neat and tidy 3 bedroom BV home
Deceiving from the street this solidly-built 3 bedroom brick veneer home is surprisingly spacious once you get inside. The modern grey tones make this home feel bright and airy. Updated kitchen in the hub of the home looks out to the privately enclosed, grassed backyard which has a small garden shed.
The bathroom also has been modernised and is off the master, with dual access for convenience for the rest of the family to utilise.
Set on an easy to manage block of 438m2, the home is so neat and tidy, and would be perfect for a first home buyer, investor or even a retiree, with ample side access for a caravan, boat or a second car to store. These well-built homes don't come up very often so it's definitely worth an inspection.
Close to public transport, supermarkets, schools, fish and chip shop and convenience stores.","SOLD - $300,000","3

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,5/7 Carpenter Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"So Fresh & So Clean!
Externally it's as solid as the day it was built, but internally this brick veneer unit has been updated to give it a contemporary feel. Located only a stone's throw from Kangaroo Flat's main shopping strip and a great supermarket, this unit is ready for you to move in to, or to hold as an investment.
Having been completely decked out in vinyl plank flooring, this unit feels light, bright & airy. A recently updated and tastefully neutral kitchen includes plenty of storage space, electric cooking, and the convenience of a dishwasher. Both bedrooms include built-in-robes and large windows. Live comfortably and enjoy the control over climate you have with a Rinnai gas heater, wall air-conditioner, and ducted cooling throughout the property. The large lounge area has room for your sofa, TV and dining table, and enjoys sunlight during the coldest months of the year. A three-piece bathroom includes a shower which sits separately from the bath, and an updated vanity. Access to the toilet is provided by walking through the bathroom or through the functional sized laundry. Stepping into the private and well-fenced (with as-new Colorbond) backyard of the unit you will find an established and low-maintenance courtyard which includes an undercover area, and twice the utility with TWO clotheslines. A remote control single-car garage provides you with safe storage of your car (which you will be able to leave there since everything is handy walking distance!)
The complex the unit sits within is peaceful and extremely well-maintained. Beside the unit, a huge lawn area with established trees provides the perfect place to socialise with your neighbours or simply relax in the shade with a book. Don't stress if gardening isn't your hobby - a gardener takes care of this area for you!
This property would suit anybody considering downsizing, or looking for their first home. It would also make an ideal investment proposition, with an expected rental return of up to $270 per week.
