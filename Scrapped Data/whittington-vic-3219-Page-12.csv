whittington-vic-3219,22 Thompson Street Whittington VIC 3219,"Huge Allotment With Unlimited Potential
Buzzing with unlimited potential this versatile property on a huge 798 sqm (approx.) block lends itself to the whole gamut of property development, from renovation and extension to subdivision and total redevelopment (STCA).
With such a substantial allotment to play with, developers will be keen to wipe the slate clean and construct a complex of up to three townhouses to either sell or keep as an instant investment portfolio (STCA). Home improvers with dreams of a big and comfortable home should put this home at the top of their list: the solid exterior offers a canvas of brick, while interiors are midway through renovation, with the bones in place for an easy transformation into a modern family home. The floorplan provides two family-sized living/dining areas, one with direct access to the back garden, and the other large enough to accommodate a study nook. The kitchen has new cabinets and timber benchtops and is now ready for the addition of appliances and other finishing touches. The master bedroom has twin built-in robes and en suite style access to the shared bathroom. The bathroom is almost complete with stone tops, new vanity, and a semi-frameless shower giving you an accurate picture of the fresh and modern space that this room will become. The 2nd bedroom is simply huge- perfect as a shared bedroom for two or more children. However, it would be very easy to add a dividing wall and separate this airy room into two private bedrooms (STCA). Mod cons include SS-AC and a wall heater.
Outside, you'll be floored by the sheer space on offer! There's ample room to accommodate several residences to the rear (STCA). However, if subdivision doesn't interest you, you'll be pleased to know that even with the addition of a hefty extension and grand Tradie's shed, there'll still be an extremely generous garden for the kids (STCA). Some work has already been completed towards a large carport or alfresco. The drive-through single lock-up garage provides secure parking, with the wide driveway on hand for additional vehicles.
This family-friendly location provides easy access to everything that matters including major shops and Secondary schooling in Newcomb, local primary schools, PT, and the Bellarine Highway. So, whatever your agenda- from renovation to redevelopment- this potential-packed property is your oyster (STCA).
Act quickly to make it yours!
- This HUGE allotment has virtually unlimited potential for subdivision & development (STCA)
- Wipe the slate clean & capitalise on this large block with up to 3 townhouses (STCA)
- Extensive renovations are mid-way, with the home ready for your finishing touches (STCA)
- Spacious floorplan provides 2 living areas that promote comfortable family living
- Save on time: the kitchen & bath both feature new benchtops & cabinetry
- The vast 2nd bed could be easily divided to provide 2 bedrooms for the kids
