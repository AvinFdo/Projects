ormond-vic-3204,27 Wallen Road ORMOND VIC 3204,"Charm, character & a peaceful location
It might have originally been built as 1 of 3 but this solid brick, north-facing home has unique charm and attractiveness - and its own Title. It's simply delightful...warm and inviting, considerately modernised so its character is not lost, and appealingly set amid lush garden surroundings. Polished floorboards create additional warmth and are enhanced by cedar venetians. There are 2 double bedrooms and a bright bathroom. The comfortable lounge room has a new gas heater, and a separate dining area leads out to the kitchen and a sunroom looking over a lovely garden with paved area at one end - ideal for relaxing with a morning coffee. A paved area at the side of the house is landscaped, large and ready to be the setting for a many alfresco entertaining occasions. Close to Ormond village shops, public transport, reserves, cafes, and recreation, this property is a 'must see'. NB: off-street parking; shed.
