- Large windows allowing natural light into the living space
- Study area in living area
- Timber floorboards in main areas
- Reconstituted stone bench tops
- Semi frameless glass shower screens
- Stainless steel cooktop, oven, dishwasher

This apartment belongs to the Yorkshire Brewery development completed a few years ago tucked away into Collingwoods' laneways. Common amenities include an outdoor BBQ area, a quiet library to watch cat videos on your iPad, a small gym - good for those morning yoga sessions and a dining area / function room to entertain your guests.
