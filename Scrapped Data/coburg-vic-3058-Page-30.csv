coburg-vic-3058,30 Watchtower Road Coburg VIC 3058,"Your Piece of Pentridge Village History!
Families will love this fabulous home with modern interiors, spacious layout and featuring a crisp contemporary palette. Oversized rooms and zoned spaces offers the ideal setting for shared living.
The ground floor features open plan living and dining, which interact directly with the kitchen and the social, private courtyard. The home chef will be in their element with an abundance of preparation and storage space, black granite benchtops, tiled splashback, gas cooktop, dishwasher, and double sink. Also on the ground floor, a fully facilitated laundry with toilet and storage room.
The bedrooms are zoned upstairs, all sharing a central bathroom with separate toilet. The Master bedroom offers a walk-in robe and adjoining access to the bathroom, and the other two bedrooms have built-in robes. A minor renovation could easily see the Master bedroom enjoying a personal ensuite in addition to the central bathroom – see prospective floorplan (or ask for further details). Further features of the property include double garaging, ducted heating, and external landscaping.
As part of the famed Pentridge Village Development, residents will love being a part of this developing community. Already home to The Glass Den – a beautiful restaurant – and frequent art/food/drink events held in B Division, the site is set to welcome much more in the near future, including cinemas, a supermarket, high-end hotel, and much more. Just 9km north of Melbourne CBD, commuters will love the short ride to work in the morning, with the nearby #19 tram running frequently to and from the city and Coburg Station is only minutes away. Enjoy walks along the Merri Creek trail on weekends, a short stroll to the Saturday Farmers' Market or play tennis at the East Coburg Tennis Club.","SOLD - $673,000","3
