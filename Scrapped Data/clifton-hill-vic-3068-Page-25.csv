This tastefully presented ground floor one bedroom apartment has a wonderfully spacious north facing private courtyard garden.
The solidity of an older style complex of quality craftsmanship provides an entry hall opening to the generous lounge room which accesses the courtyard and allows northern light to stream throughout. A functional and funky style kitchen adjoins and there's an ample bedroom with robes and larger bathroom than normal.
Interestingly the floorplan also includes separate laundry which could be harnessed for modern living and expansion of the footprint. In very comfortable condition for living or renting but possessing the potential to become something more in this coveted locale with everything from shops, parks and transport on the doorstep whilst still including a car space.","SOLD - $395,000","1

STABLE CONVERSION
The exterior of this two plus storey iron stable belies the transformation that has taken place internally to make an upside down inner city thoroughbred.
Once a stable, motor repairer and even bedding manufacturer this CGI clad home still possesses the quirkiness of its history retaining the loft doors that, when open, provide a great view from the living room. The new roller door is camouflaged with older cladding and the only hint of what’s to be found inside comes from the new glass frosted entry door.
Upside down? Well the two bedrooms are on the ground floor and open to the rear compact northerly courtyard, there’s also a large single garage, family bathroom and concealed laundry. Ascend a set of polished stairs to the open plan living with contemporary stone topped kitchen with an open lofty dining/ family area, a separate sitting room which with loft doors and a study nook. A powder room with shower is central to the configuration.
For the brave of heart there’s a ladder style stair that ascends to the loft attic with rustic beams in the upper roof line of the dwelling, which could be another bedroom, office or retreat.
With ducted heating and air conditioning, this contemporary inner sanctum has richly polished hardwood floors, neutral colour schemes and takes advantage of its northern aspect through large frosted glazings.
Around the corner from the village you’ll own one of the more unique and talked about homes in the area.","SOLD - $821,000","3

WHAT LIES BEHIND THE FACADE?
This former shop and dwelling undertook a stylish architect designed transformation some years ago to create a contemporary abode blending the charm of the period with a modern twist. The expansive ground floor entry reveals behind the red door with high ceilings and an eclectic original linoleum floor blending to a terra cotta tiled rear section with central powder room, adjoining laundry and modern kitchen with meals area opening vi multiple French doors to the rear garden with lock up garage.
Upstairs are three genuine bedrooms, the front taking full advantage of the width and northern outlook over the street plus a central family bathroom. There’s enough period features retained with open fire places to create a warm atmosphere coupled with the inclusion of hydronic heating, modern lighting systems plus a few surprises that will further capture your imagination.
If the property itself doesn’t whet the appetite sufficiently look at the locality ... in a village side proximity with the Royal Hotel, Cafe Quince and on top of the Station you’ll hunt a long time to find better value for money.
