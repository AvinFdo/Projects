Completing the flowing floorplan is a spotless family bathroom with separate toilet, a laundry and three generously-sized bedrooms with an exclusive ensuite and walk in robe to the master. Outside, the low-maintenance garden is ideal for entertaining guests on the covered deck and provides easy access to the secure double garage with plenty of lawn space for the pets and kids to enjoy.
Additional extras include gas ducted heating throughout and a split system for year-round comfort along with off-street parking and ramp access from the deck to the garden.
An idyllic first home, downsizer, investment or retiree's nest with its own sense of independence, the property is located across the road from Eastfield Shopping Mall and is walking distance to Pinjarra Kindergarten, Cheong Park, Eastfield dog park, as well as being just a short drive from Ringwood East Railway Station, Tinternvale Primary School, Tintern Grammar, Croydon Memorial Pool, EastLink freeway and Merrindale Shopping Centre.
