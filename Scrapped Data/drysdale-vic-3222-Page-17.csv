drysdale-vic-3222,34-36 Buccleugh Street Drysdale VIC 3222,"Solid 3-bedroom brick home on huge block
Looking at this comfortable home from the street perspective, you’ll be impressed by the size of the double block with its expansive front lawn and mature Silver Birch trees. But step out the back and you’ll be blown away by the scale of the rest of the block. It’s not only big - it’s also a really big opportunity for the smart investor. Walking up the brick-paved drive you’re greeted by twin garage doors at the western end of the house - so there’s plenty of storage space here. On entering, the front sitting room gives way to a smaller dining annex, and north-facing windows capture welcome warmth and light. The open-plan kitchen and lounge also offers more dining space and a corner TV. There’s a return serving bench in the kitchen, plus an electric Westinghouse wall oven and bench-top hot plates, a pantry and a split system. The passage leads to a laundry with a separate WC and shower, and three bedrooms - all with BIRs - that share a tiled bathroom with shower, vanity and separate WC. One double bedroom has the luxury of an air-conditioner. Currently, the back garden consists of a massive lawn, numerous fruit trees, and native bushes and trees on the boundary fences. Plus there’s a chook pen and a genuine Hills hoist. Kick a footy or play backyard cricket - there’s no shortage of room. This well-maintained home is perfectly liveable now, and has potential for renovations. But clearly, subdivision and redevelopment (STCA) are the really exciting options.
