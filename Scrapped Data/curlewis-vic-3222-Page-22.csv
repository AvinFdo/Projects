curlewis-vic-3222,2/21 The Court Leopold VIC 3224,"Low-Maintenance Living Has Never Looked So Good.
Have you been dreaming of low-maintenance living but don't want to compromise on space or quality? Then this is the one for you. Whether you're a first homebuyer, downsizer, or investor, you'll need to act swiftly to secure this Leopold gem.
Positioned in a peaceful pocket, you can enjoy a quiet lifestyle while still being close to everyday essentials. Public transport and the Ash Road shops are a short stroll away, while the expansive Gateway Plaza is close by for all of your shopping and dining needs. Young families will appreciate that Leopold Kindergarten, Leopold P.S. and the Leopold Community Hub are all within walking distance. Easy access to sporting grounds and the Gateway Sanctuary inspires you to venture outdoors. Just jump in the car, and you'll soon be in the heart of Geelong or exploring the Bellarine Peninsula.
High, square set ceilings and polished floorboards grace the immaculate interiors. The open plan living/dining/kitchen zone unites with the north-facing alfresco deck - creating a generous setting for both everyday living and for when loved ones come to visit. Whether you want to relax under the shade sail or soak up the sunshine, the private deck will effortlessly accommodate. The kitchen will delight cooking enthusiasts with a built-in pantry, breakfast bar and stainless steel appliances (dishwasher, oven, gas cooktop, rangehood).
Zoned to the front of the home, the Master Bedroom features built-in robes and an en suite with large shower. Two additional bedrooms with built-in robes share close access to the main bathroom and separate toilet. The generous study boasts a built-in desk and storage perfect for students and home business owners alike! The laundry is complete with storage and external access.
You'll be comfortable all year long thanks to ducted heating, a split-system air conditioner and ceiling fans. Updates over the last two years include freshly painted interiors, new carpet, new remote garage door, new hot water service and a new oven and gas cooktop. The remote double lock-up garage features internal access, while a 2100L rainwater tank adds the final touch to this low-maintenance gem.","SOLD - $472,500","3
