white-hills-vic-3550,4 Jude Court Spring Gully VIC 3550,"AMAZING LIFESTYLE
This is a rare opportunity to purchase an extremely well-built home which backs onto the Bendigo Regional Park. The home sits in a quiet cul de sac with an elevated outlook towards Autumn Gully.

Offering a sunken lounge with solid fuel heater and cathedral ceilings, spacious kitchen / meals / family room, 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. If you like your toys or hobbies there is plenty of room for you with a large double garage under the house, a big workshop/ shed / hobby room plus additional storage which might make a great wine cellar. There is also a large 2 car carport ideal for a boat or most caravans. An additional single garage completes the car accommodation. Wonderfully landscaped gardens compliment the secluded setting. Great access to the city centre and Spring Gully primary school.
This wonderful home is really quite special.

white-hills-vic-3550,56 Bungoona Ct Cornella VIC 3551,"An Ideal Get-Away Property
HANDYMAN'S DELIGHT!
What an opportunity! Originally on the market at $230,000, this partially cleared bush block of 46 acres approx of undulating land has now been reduced to $210,000!
Zoned Rural Living and sitting in a secluded court position, it has a gentle slope and some flat areas ideal for building. Enjoying some cleared areas, the block has assorted groups of trees dotted over the block, and a lovely dam. As a bonus there is power to the street as well as an electricity pole on the land itself.
As an additional bonus, there is also an old two bedroom shack with kitchen and open plan living. This structure is in need of restoration as it has been damaged by a fallen tree (since removed) but would once again make a comfortable weekender for someone with handyman ability.
Cornella is a lovely part of the country, wineries abound and Camelback Vinyard is at the end of the street. Situated only 10 minutes approx from the Toolleen General store and popular Hotel and 20 minutes approx from the delightful town of Heathcote, well known for its wonderful wineries. Bendigo is just 40 minutes away and Melbourne a short 2 hour approx drive. This would be a great place to unwind. Phone to inspect.

white-hills-vic-3550,22 Kingston Drive Eaglehawk VIC 3556,"An Absolute Hole In One!
Nestled behind the low maintenance Established gardens of 22 Kingston Drive is this three bedroom beauty with so much more than meets the eye.
Stepping inside you will immediately appreciate the sense of elegance and feel right at home with 8 foot ceilings, Wide hallways and LED Downlights throughout.
The Kitchen, living and dining areas immediately grabs your attention complete with Induction Cooktop, 900mm Oven, LG Dishwasher, Caesarstone benchtops & an abundance of storage space in the kitchen. A Rennai Gas log fire sits within the wall of the lounge area providing a touch of class to an already sophisticated area.
All three bedrooms that occupy the property are of ample size. The master containing a walk in robe and ensuite bathroom complete with double vanity, extra-large shower and separate toilet. The remaining two bedrooms have built in robes. A central bathroom can also be found in this area of the home containing a bath, single vanity and shower with a second separate toilet.
The study of the home is more than meets the eye. Once the fourth bedroom for the property, this room can easily be converted back into a bedroom. But as it currently stands, two built in desks sit in the room with an abundance of desk space on each. Between the two desks is a murphy bed folded into the room, so without even needing to convert the room back this area already lends itself to provide that extra bed space for guests. Or this area can be used as a third living area.
In the backyard of the property the theme of a low maintained lifestyle continues. With all areas of the backyard being either turfed, tiled or concreted. You (or your tenants) will be able to enjoy the fantastic outdoor entertaining area without any concerns of the gardens getting away from you. There is a wood fire undercover to stay warm and connections are in place if you wish to add an outdoor kitchen to the area.
All this is located literally across the road from the Neangar Park Golf Club and in close proximity to Eaglehawk CBD, Eaglehawk Primary and secondary schools and a cruisy 10 minute drive (approx.) into the Bendigo CBD.","SOLD - $440,000","3

This section of the house also includes a family bathroom, separate toilet, and a laundry with sliding door access to the side yard.
A large formal lounge towards the front of the home overlooks a lawn area at one side of the house, and at the end of the main hallway is the light and bright open plan kitchen, living and dining room. With dual aspect glass sliding doors, this room is flooded with natural light and the additional windows ensure there is space to watch the kids outside, wherever they choose to play.
At the rear of the house is a wide deck, perfect for outdoor entertaining, and this overlooks a neat lawn and garden beds with established planting. The other side of the home offers a sunny paved courtyard, lawn and a wide verandah that wraps around the house.

white-hills-vic-3550,71a/ Kent Place Strathfieldsaye VIC 3551,"Regent Park - Strathfieldsaye
Here's your chance to secure a block in an already booming established estate with its own children's playground, Jenny's Early Learning Centre and easy access to public transport!
Perfect for families and only a quick drive to Bendigo CBD.
The beautiful open entrance gives way to plenty of space, with approximately 3 acres of park filled with native and exotic trees and bushland, 800m of walking paths as well as benches and shelter making the perfect spot to get together. All allotments are titled and are waiting to be built on.
Situated on 449m2 with a frontage of 21m, offers a great option for side driveway access depending on design. Being a small allotment it also promotes a great opportunity for investors to put townhouses or units on, or build smaller home without the ongoing maintenance of a large yard.","SOLD - $157,000",449m²,Vacant land,Sold by private treaty 10 Aug 2020,0,"ALL
