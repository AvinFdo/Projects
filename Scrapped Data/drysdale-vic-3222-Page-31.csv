drysdale-vic-3222,68-70 Whitcombes Road DRYSDALE VIC 3222,"Contemporary acreage lifestyle with views
Set on approx. 1 acre of grounds, this 4 bedroom home with 4 living areas is contemporary, light-filled and big on lifestyle! The 2-storey floor plan offers a private parent's retreat upstairs showcasing calming You Yangs and Bay views. Downstairs a tiered deck provides indoor/outdoor living options, with floor-to-ceiling glazing and French doors embracing natural light and tranquil, semi-rural views. Polished hardwood floors, European appliances and impressive undercover entertaining denote quality and style. The in-ground pool and established subtropical garden are a welcome surprise!
The tiered deck approach sets the scene for modern living indoors. On level 1, the open floor plan has a circular flow, connecting living and dining zones. For relaxation, choose the bright sitting room or sunken formal lounge. Both face north boasting seamless access to the deck through French doors. RC AC assists comfort here.
Flow continues from the sitting room, to the kitchen/living/dining hub and back to the entrance. The kitchen has a high-end feel with Kleenmaid appliances (900mm electric oven with gas cooktop), soft-close cabinetry and step-in pantry. Living and dining bask in the warmth of a wood burning fire. Dining merges with the undercover entertaining area, set under a striking curved roofline. Generously proportioned, and designed for year-round use, this outdoor room links with a spacious lawn and the pool area.
The minor bedroom wing buds off the entrance hall to the west, and houses a fully-tiled bathroom with bath and in situ shower, separate toilet and three bedrooms with built-in robes. The largest bedroom boasts French doors to a private balcony; the smaller, an optional study.
The views and tranquillity upstairs are reserved for the parents. In the lofty living area, extensive glazing frames Bay, You Yangs and treetop views, and a wide glass slider accesses a roomy balcony directed at the view. The L-shaped design accommodates a generous study nook. In the master bedroom, the walk-in robe and 2-way en suite emphasize the self-contained feel.
The grounds are graced with beautiful deciduous trees and a large rear paddock with vegetable gardens and chicken coop providing a level of self-sufficiency. The gated driveway provides 2 secure parking spots and leads to a DLUG with workshop and single carport.
A household water treatment plant is connected to garden irrigation. A 5000L water tank aids irrigation and tops up the solar heated pool.
This semi-rural lifestyle property is convenient to family amenities and sought-after schools. View without delay!

This beautifully designed three bedroom abode will exceed your expectations.
Set in idyllic Carlotta Place, the north-facing home overlooks landscaped parkland and enjoys a quiet outlook with very little through traffic.
The interior feels contemporary and grand, with neutral tones that compliment any colour scheme. Heightened ceilings and doorways amplify space, and natural light floods every room. Windows throughout are finished with elegant shutter style blinds.
At the heart of the home, the open plan kitchen/living/dining hub has a light and airy feel. You'll enjoy easy access to the private backyard and undercover decked entertaining area via sliding stacker doors, which retract to provide an expansive indoor/outdoor living zone.

Extravagant 40mm Caesarstone benchtops will impress, and stainless steel appliances include a 900mm Technika electric oven with gas cooktop, glass canopy rangehood and Bellissimo dishwasher. The island bench with breakfast bar is ideal for informal dining. The spacious walk-in pantry houses the fridge, and hides the clutter!
The rear of the home boasts an expansive and private master suite. It features a fully fitted walk-through robe with 'His' and 'Hers' sections, plus a light-filled and contemporary ensuite. Luxurious inclusions, such as the double shower with rain head and hand-held rose and the soft-close toilet, mean you may never want to leave!
The two large queen-size bedrooms include built-in robes with sliding doors and are near the central bathroom, which features a large floating vanity, huge shower, niche cut-out, and a deep luxurious bath.
A separate lounge (or optional 4th bedroom) speaks of uninterrupted TV viewing and quiet time overlooking the park.
