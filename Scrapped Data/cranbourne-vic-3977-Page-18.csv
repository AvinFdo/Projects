cranbourne-vic-3977,15 Belmar Street Cranbourne VIC 3977,"**SOLD BY PAUL RINGERI**
CRANBOURNE: **THE PERFECT FIRST HOME OR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ADDITION** After an unprecedented period of growth in real estate prices, the recent easing in the market has given first home buyers and shrewd investors the best chance in years to secure a great property at a fair price. 15 Belmar Street should be in sharp focus for these buying groups given its neat condition, appealing position and potential to further renovate whilst adding significant value.
Well cared for over the past 35 years the property itself features a perfectly sized block with a tandem carport that drives through to the double garage. With covered parking for a total of 4 full sized vehicles, there is also the option to use the shed as a large workshop, hobby room or as a man cave.
Step inside to find a functional floorplan that features a spacious lounge that adjoins the separate meals area. The modernised kitchen is complete with stainless steel appliances including an oven, cooktop and a dishwasher.
There are 3 bedrooms, each with built-in wardrobes, as well as a family bathroom and separate toilet. Ducted heating, ceiling fans, evaporative cooling and a split system air-conditioner each provide seasonal climate control throughout the year.
Outside you will also find a side entertainment area together with a secure backyard with beautiful mature trees and a shed for added storage facilities.
Set on a generous block of app. 604m2 this is the perfect opportunity to land bank given the property's future development potential (S.T.C.A.)!
If you believe in the age-old theory that good real estate revolves around a central location then you won't be disappointed. Positioned in a quiet back street location it's hard to believe this budget buster is still set within minutes of everything that Cranbourne has to offer. If you need easy access to parkland, train stations, buses, local schools and Cranbourne Park shopping centre then this gem is a certain addition to your inspection list. Within moments of freeways and Eastlink, you are never going to be too far away from your next day out in the city!
BOOK AN INSPECTION TODAY, IT MAY BE GONE TOMORROW - PHOTO ID REQUIRED AT OPEN FOR INSPECTIONS!
