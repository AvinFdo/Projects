doncaster-vic-3108,503/91-93 Tram Road Doncaster VIC 3108,"Flawless north-facing apartment
On the 5th floor of the architect-designed Madison residential building near Westfield Doncaster, this spacious 2 bedroom apartment comprises 2 bathrooms and a north-facing living room accessing a generous north-facing alfresco balcony with views towards Westfield.
Both carpeted bedrooms face east and have floor-to-ceiling wardrobes, serviced by 2 bathrooms with stone-feature vanities, toilets and generous showers. The master bedroom with an ensuite enjoys floor-to-ceiling windows, whilst the primary bathroom incorporates a European laundry.
An open study is a valuable space for a home office, yet the highlight is the sun-soaked living and dining room with hardwood floors and large windows, surrounding a Smeg stainless steel kitchen (dishwasher, gas cooktop and electric oven) with stone benchtops and a glass splashback.
The ultra-secure complex has video intercom, bicycle parking and secure basement parking. This exquisite apartment enjoys 1 car space and a storage cage, complementing Mitsubishi climate control and dual sheer and blockout roller blinds. Walk to Westfield's boutique shops, gourmet eateries and transport hub, with proximity to the Eastern freeway for fast access to the CBD.","SOLD - $581,000","2

doncaster-vic-3108,10 Wilsons Road Doncaster VIC 3108,"A perfect 10 in location and opportunity.
Contemplate what you could create on this exciting 721sqm (approx.) corner block in a premier Doncaster pocket, and as you do, enjoy the feeling of your pockets filling with income thanks to the existing tenancy agreement in place!
Currently tenanted at $1738 per calendar month until January 2018, you therefore have the luxury of time on your side as you consider all the options before you. Naturally, its first-class corner site makes building a collection of ultra-contemporary town residences with their own street frontages and no common land (STCA) an obvious choice, yet the chance to start again in an established location with a brand new designer home (STCA) will also inspire the growing family eager to live within a short stroll of the highly-regarded Birralee Primary School, Westfield Shoppingtown, Wilsons Rd Reserve, bus services and the Koonung Creek Trail.
Hallmarked by its generous proportions and featuring light-filled open-plan living, modern kitchen, spacious bedrooms serviced by a central bathroom, ducted heating, split-system cooling, ample off-street parking and convenient access to Koonung Secondary College and the Eastern Freeway, an option also exists to move in, add a modern touch or two and enjoy all the spoils of this fabulous location with the prospect of developing at a later date (STCA).","SOLD - $1,480,000","3
