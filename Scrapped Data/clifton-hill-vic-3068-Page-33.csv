clifton-hill-vic-3068,17 Noone Street CLIFTON HILL VIC 3068,"THE ONE YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR!
This inviting Edwardian residence (ca 1910) typifies the perennial charm of Clifton Hill. At the prized city end of Noone Street, just minutes from the CBD, it has been tastefully renovated to offer three light-filled bedrooms, a spacious living room and a delightful outdoor entertaining area. The red brick façade, with metal window canopy and fretwork-arched verandah, ensures immediate street appeal. Entry is to a wide hallway, floored in Baltic pine, opening to two double bedrooms (both with quality built-in wardrobes) and a smaller third bedroom. The main bedroom, like the well-proportioned living room in the centre of the house, features elegant Art Nouveau cornices and picture rails. Opening from the living room is a bright kitchen and meals area, with stainless steel appliances, timber-finished cabinets and the original pine lining boards. Set to the rear of the house, the bright bathroom is fitted with modern laundry facilities. The large rear courtyard, shaded by a mature fig tree, has recently been paved and landscaped. It includes a second WC and large shed with rear access. Fittings include gas and panel heating, split-system air conditioning, quality carpets and plantation shutters.
With all the amenities of Village living - nearby parkland, cafes and primary schools - here is a property which offers tasteful and comfortable living now, with exciting potential for extension in the future (STCA).

This renovated Victorian terrace radiates perennial appeal! Situated on a particularly deep allotment of 43m (142’), with a classic lace-trimmed verandah and smartly painted façade, this ideally located home is set back from the street behind a neat picket fence. Two or three bedrooms (the main overlooking a side courtyard), lead off the arched hallway before it opens out into a timber-floored informal living area and smart new kitchen with stone benchtops and stainless steel appliances. A glass-walled passage to the rear leads to a good-sized tiled bathroom and a study. The prized north-facing paved courtyard gives access to a full sized laundry. A substantial brick garage opens to a right of way. With potential for extension (STCA), this attractive property featuring period detail and ample storage is superbly situated close to Yarra parkland, Spensley Street Primary and Village cafes.
