dandenong-vic-3175,14 Herbert Street Dandenong VIC 3175,"Keep the Front, Build at the Back or Demolish & Build 3 (STCA)
Positioned in one of central Dandenongs best locations, this property which sits on a lot size of 753 sqm (approximately) makes an outstanding development prospect. With walking access to all amenities including Dandenong Hospital, High School, Market and Plaza as well as public transport services and Dandenongs CBD, the property is perfectly positioned for future capital growth and high resale of newly built dwellings on the land. The existing solid brick home provides enormous character and potential and with a small investment can be updated to a modern masterpiece with possibility to retain and build an additional dwelling in the backyard (STCA). Alternatively you can bring your bulldozer and start from scratch with potential to redevelop the entire block with 3 brand new townhouses/units (STCA). Comprising 2 bedrooms, formal lounge area or potentially 3rd bedroom, open kitchen and dining area, central family bathroom and separate toilet and beautifully light filled family room/sunroom which overlooks the backyard. With existing tenant currently paying $340 per week this property makes a perfect investment. Arrange to inspect before it is too late!
