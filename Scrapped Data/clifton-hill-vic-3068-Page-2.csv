It's the exceptional list of extras that set this freestanding three bedroom Victorian apart from the rest: impressive extra-width, quiet north-side Kiewa Street frontage, cathedral ceiling open-plan living plus rear ROW. Ideally located in a coveted parklands pocket enjoying Merri Creek and Yarra River trails, this tuckpointed Hawthorn brick corner terrace represents a unique opportunity for an absolutely superb lifestyle near cafes, schools, Clifton Hill train station and inner-city shopping precincts. The single-level layout with previously-extended living area is perfectly composed and completely comfortable, and with a simple refurbishment would be stunning. Alternatively, a luxury renovation (STCA) is an enticing option to introduce further space and value. As it currently stands, this inviting period residence offers main bedroom with classic features (ceiling rose, gutter cornice, double windows, open fireplace), spacious living and dining room adjoining a functional kitchen (polished concrete floor, soaring trussed ceiling, double-glazed bifold doors), bright bathroom, separate laundry, gas ducted heating, side court access with storage and sunny rear courtyard garden. Excellent location, exciting potential, extraordinary opportunity!","SOLD - $1,000,000","3

clifton-hill-vic-3068,10 Yambla Street Clifton Hill VIC 3068,"""Pensilva"" - a sublime family sanctuary near parklands
An historic heart, contemporary soul and free-flowing family spirit are held in a beautiful reverence with architect-extended 'Pensilva'; a stunning freestanding Victorian in an extra broad and deep landscaped setting. Originally the mill manager's home as he came and went to the nearby Yarra River's Dights Falls, this captivating 1800s residence with its decorative arched hallway and high ornate ceilings, welcomes all with wide open arms from an immediately engaging past into a spacious and sophisticated present. Featured in Home Beautiful, the hub of the house is a double-sized family living and dining space where a timber-slatted wall and towering double-glazed stackers connect the inside with out to a large deck-trimmed lawn - perfect for kids' play and secluded alfresco entertaining. The original stable and hay loft have been incorporated into the design creating an upstairs parents' retreat cloaked in a soft white palette highlighted by a trussed timber ceiling, separate study, walk-in robe and ensuite. An exquisite rose and chandelier crown a gorgeous central living room (wood heater) that leads to 2 further big bedrooms (BIRs), laundry and luxurious family bathroom with walk-in shower and freestanding bath on natural bluestone floor tiles. Adjoining the light-filled family zone on large-format, concrete-look porcelain tiles is a streamlined modern kitchen with pale stone surfaces and Ilve/Bosch appliances. Additional features include ducted heating/cooling, alarm, custom joinery, attic storage and Baltic pine floors. 'Pensilva' is peacefully tucked away in an inner-city parklands pocket by the Merri Creek and Yarra River just moments to cafes, schools, walking/cycling trails, shopping precincts and Clifton Hill station. Dual frontage to quiet Clifford Place creates easy access for secure off-street parking with remote-control door.
