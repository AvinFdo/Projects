Both the formal lounge and formal dining room are graced with an open fireplace - creating an enticing setting for both relaxation and hosting loved ones. Northern light sweeps through the kitchen/meals zone, where the kitchen features timber cabinetry, a large island bench, ample storage, and Miele appliances (dishwasher, oven, electric cooktop).
The Master Bedroom overlooks the front garden, while three additional bedrooms (two with built-in robes, one with built-in cabinetry) share close access to the versatile sunroom/second living room. The sunroom wraps around the north and eastern side of the home, with French doors opening onto the fully enclosed veranda to create a lovely sense of flow.
