Set on a large block in a highly desirable pocket of old Highton, this flexible floorplan offers self-contained living downstairs, making it perfect for families who want to give the kids their own space, or investors looking to maximise their return.
Those working and learning from home will love having a separate study, finally putting an end to working at the dining table! The magnificent north-facing balcony provides scenic views of the barwon river making it a perfect breakout space and - in good time - entertainment space to have your family and friends over.
The large backyard is heaven for the greenthumb, or you may wish to install some new turf to provide a great playspace for the kids. With multiple basketball rings set up out the front of neighbouring homes, this is clearly a great community for families and the kids will make friends in no time. Loads of solar panels will help keep the cost of living down, and you're just moments away from everything like schools and supermarkets.
If youre looking at the floorplan and wondering where the stairs come out on the lower floor - theyve been blocked off to make the lower floor truly self contained but easily reopened!
