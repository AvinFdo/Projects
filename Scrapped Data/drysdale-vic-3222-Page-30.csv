drysdale-vic-3222,2/42 Clifton Springs Road DRYSDALE VIC 3222,"CAN'T GET MUCH CLOSER!
You seriously can't get much closer to the shops and facilities at Drysdale. Everything you require to enjoy life in this lovely town is literally a very short stroll away from this Townhouse. The current Vendors have enjoyed living here and have kept the home well maintained so there is nothing to do but move in. We get many requests for townhouses/units close to amenities so I don't anticipate this one being on the market very long. Open plan kitchen, meals and lounge overlook a very pretty low maintenance garden and a nice place to sit outside undercover and read the paper with your drink of choice. Comprising two bedrooms, walk in robe in the main, built in the 2nd. Off the main living is a room currently used as a study. Remotely operated double garage with internal access. Other features include two split systems, security awnings; the toilet uses a water tank for function, solar hot water that is gas boosted. Gutter guard means never having to clean the gutters again.
I am waiting for your call to book a time to have a look.","SOLD - $350,000","2

drysdale-vic-3222,24 Gange Place DRYSDALE VIC 3222,"Live a First Class Family Lifestyle
Presented as beautifully as a display home but with the warmth and charm that can only come from being lived in, this seven year old Hotondo built home is certainly appealing and inviting from the street but just wait until you get inside! As much as you will appreciate the rendered facade and tiered gardens with boardwalk style decking and hope that the interior will be just as attractive, what you find beyond the entry door is an exciting and unexpected surprise...
This home is HUGE!! Not only is it huge but it is also stunning! The quality of the construction is immediately evident and only continues to please as you discover all of its features. The polished timber floors in the wide entrance hall continue right through the main living area, as does the square stop cornicing. The downlighting is a feature throughout the entire house as are the top quality window furnishings. The stone accents in the family bathroom and master ensuite (with separate WC) add highlights to the neutral tonings of the home and the abundance of pot drawers in the massive kitchen (with 900mm stainless steel cooker and dishwasher) speak of the many practical considerations that have been cleverly incorporated into the design.
With 3 large living areas and 4 generous bedrooms, there is ample room here for growing families and the 720 sq m allotment allows plenty of room for both children's play as well as adult entertaining. The current owners have gone to a lot of trouble to ensure that each of these activities is just as pleasurable as the indoor living with the low maintenance gardens tiered and terraced in the back yard to provide a private, sunny decked alfresco adjacent the kitchen/meals as well as a spacious flat lawn behind the home.
Space and position have been well utilised with the elevation of the block allowing lovely valley views across to Geelong and glimpses of the bay. At night, with all of the lights twinkling, the outlook from the picture windows really comes alive. However, what lies beneath the home is just as significant a feature with three full bays of concreted storage (including a wine cellar) complete with lockable roller door and lighting. This space alone is testament to the thought, love and care that has gone into this home and proves, without a doubt that your purchase of this property will be a sound one that will provide your family with many, many years of joy.
