cranbourne-vic-3977,5 Norwood Court Cranbourne VIC 3977,"**SOLD BY PAUL RINGERI**
RANGEBANK ESTATE, CRANBOURNE: **VENDOR MEETS THE MARKET** If you love the idea of a modern home, but find the blocks offered in today's new estates to be undersized and cramped, then 5 Norwood Court is the perfect alternative!
Constructed in 2013 and set on a very generous block measuring a healthy 809m2, the secure court location is ideal for those with growing families. With a presentable front yard offering established gardens that frame the pale brick facade perfectly, you simply move in and enjoy!
Step inside to find display quality presentation making you feel instantly comfortable and at home. There's plenty of accommodation available with 4 robed bedrooms, the front set master complete with a full ensuite and walk in wardrobe. The rear 3 bedrooms are conveniently positioned around the family bathroom and 2nd toilet!
Living space is plentiful as well with a separate lounge that could easily serve as a home theatre room, plus a vast tiled family/meals area that overlooks the gorgeous all white kitchen with stone benches and stainless appliances.
Ducted heating and a large split system air-conditioner provide additional year round comfort, whilst outside there's a double garage with remote door and internal access plus gated side access for those needing additional secure parking facilities.
Don't forget the massive backyard with an outstanding under-roofline alfresco that spans the entire width of the home. Boasting a full outdoor kitchen and pull down blinds that give it year round usability, this is the ideal place to relax with friends whilst the kids and pets run a muck in the private yard.
If you believe in the age old theory that a top location equals great real estate then this is an absolute must to inspect. Sensational position within walking distance to Rangebank Primary School and kindergarten. There's also easy access to buses, Merinda Park train station and Thompson Road, which provides direct access to all of the shopping facilities on offer at the Cranbourne Home Maker Centre!
With turnover in this ever popular estate at an all-time low don't muck around or else you will miss out!
BOOK AN INSPECTION TODAY, IT MAY BE GONE TOMORROW - PHOTO ID REQUIRED AT OPEN FOR INSPECTIONS!
