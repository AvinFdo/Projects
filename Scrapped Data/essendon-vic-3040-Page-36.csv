essendon-vic-3040,41 Leslie Road Essendon VIC 3040,"Unequivocally In A Class Of Its Own
Undeniably one of Melbourne’s most illustrious homes, without doubt, Essendon’s most impressive property, this landmark residence delivers peerless family luxury on an exceptionally large, elegantly landscaped allotment of approx. 2168m2. Exterior aesthetics that reflect the Tudor inspired, mid-1930s character of a design by C Stewart Russell, leading architects of the era, are matched by dramatic interior spaces which reveal the quality of their comprehensive renovation. The effect, both inside and out, is unforgettable. A majestic entrance foyer introduces a zoned floor-plan that effortlessly matches period personality with the capacity to meet every modern need. Refined formal sitting and dining rooms and an inviting study or den are complemented by a charming central lounge and a light-filled family living/dining domain that flows to the gardens through walls of bi-fold doors. An open plan kitchen finished in granite, fitted with the full suite of Gaggenau appliances, is a daily delight. Five bedrooms served by three superb travertine bathrooms include a main bedroom enjoying its own downstairs wing and courtyard retreat. In addition, a dedicated upstairs children’s study and state-of-the-art cinema room confirm this home’s first class comfort. A substantial cellar, hydronic heating, reverse cycle air-conditioning, hand-cut crystal chandeliers from Schonbek and Schembri walnut inlay cabinetry enhance indoor allure while a flood-lit north-south tennis court, heated pool with fabulous pavilion and a double garage illustrate garden excellence. Every space thrills the senses.
And the address? Appropriately, amongst Essendon’s best - discreet, distinguished yet mere moments from prestigious schools, shopping and transport.
