doncaster-vic-3108,8 Heritage Boulevard Doncaster VIC 3108,"Parkside luxury in the exclusive Tullamore Estate.
Boasting a coveted parkside position in the exclusive Tullamore Estate, this contemporary four-bedroom showpiece balances glamour and sophistication with practicality and functionality in one of Manninghams favourite estates for family living.
A celebration of high-end living for the growing family desiring space without the burden of high-maintenance gardening, the meticulously designed interior blends three separate living areas with zoned bedrooms of generous proportions, while appointments of a superior standard envelop the home with five-star quality.
Enjoy the intimate nature of the sun-kissed lounge whilst soaking up the views, while a spectacular north-facing open-plan living domain generates instant wow factor with its enormous proportions, huge gourmet kitchen (with chic feature island bench, window splashback, quality ILVE stainless steel appliances and Butlers pantry) and integration with the undercover alfresco that frames an uninterrupted view across neighbouring parkland.
The central carpeted retreat upstairs acts as a successful buffer between the deluxe master bedroom (with walk-in robe, luxurious fully-tiled ensuite with a soaker bath and private balcony with a relaxing park view), three additional bedrooms (one with walk-in robe and fully-tiled ensuite) and large fully-tiled family bathroom, while fully landscaped gardens are low in maintenance yet high in aesthetic appeal.
This feature-packed home also enjoys the benefits of a remote double garage with dual internal access points, carpeted study with views, ducted heating/cooling, separate laundry and more.
Spend weekends exploring the large playground or scenic walking trails that are only footsteps away, while living within 13km (approx.) east of Melbourne's CBD yet even closer to the Eastern Freeway, the Park + Ride, excellent schools (highly regarded Birralee Primary School among them) and Westfield Shoppingtown enhances the appeal of this first-class family lifestyle upgrade.","SOLD - $1,675,000","4
