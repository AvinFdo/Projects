clifton-hill-vic-3068,21 Edmund Street Clifton Hill VIC 3068,"Charming Art Deco Revitalised ... Auction This Saturday View from 10.45
The charm of the Art Deco period has been encapsulated in the modern renovation and refurbishment of this two bedroom home on a prominent corner position allowing natural light to stream throughout each room.
A side portico provides central entry to the two spacious bedrooms each with built in robes, the main with a built in window box seat, a large formal lounge room with feature fire place, comfortable bathroom and then a modernised kitchen with adjoining meals and informal sitting area overlooking the rear paved courtyard.
You'll be able to move straight in or rent this comfortable home but more modern updates could be considered to maximise the potential of the home.
Polished floor boards, high decorative ceilings coupled with central heating and split system air-conditioners blend the old with the new and create an enviable lifestyle.
Outside there's a single carport with an adjoining garden shed that houses a water tank system to look after the yard and for extra storage there's a ceiling cavity accessed by a professionally installed ceiling ladder.
To round out the offering, consider the location ... walking distance to the Village, the station, the Merri and Yarra bike and walking trails and tucked in just behind Spensley St Primary.
