Located in beautiful Creswick North, this stunning 15 acres freehold title plus crown lease land bringing the total usable land to close to 22 acres, it comes complete with a current planning permit to build a 4 bedroom home.

The views are all the way to Waubra to the West, as the creek ambles through the countryside, while to the South East the Creek winds its way towards the distant hills.
The Crown lease gives the land direct creek frontage - you can apply for water rights if you wish, or there is usually good ground water around 30 - 35 meters deep along the ridge if you would rather install a bore. A spring fed stock dam completes the available water package!","SOLD - $300,000",6.07ha,Rural,Sold by private treaty 21 Sep 2018,"95 Four Star Road, Creswick VIC 3363 was last sold in 2018.",0,https://www.domain.com.au/95-four-star-road-creswick-vic-3363-2014115202,"Neighbourhood Insights
