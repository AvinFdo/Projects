coronet-bay-vic-3984,11A Kilburn Street Corinella VIC 3984,"GRAND EDWARDIAN CHARM IN AN IDYLLIC COASTAL SETTING!
Set on a large 1025m2 allotment, this beautifully appointed 4-bedroom family home presents the classic grand design and charm of the Edwardian era. It is the one of a kind in the quiet coastal town of Corinella, so offers a completely unique lifestyle opportunity.
From the moment you enter the double width hallway of this impressive property, youll be captivated by its soaring ceilings, scale of rooms and the timeless elegance of period features characterising Edwardian architecture.
The entrance hallway passes three capacious bedrooms, superbly styled to suit the setting, each with split-system air conditioning.
The first master bedroom features ensuite, walk-in robe, a delightful single bay window with leadlight and double doors to a private porch. The second and third bedrooms are equally spacious to fit king-size beds and furniture, with large built-in-robes.
Past the staircase is an inviting formal lounge with cosy gas-log fireplace. The hallway finally opens to the magnificent heart of the home, a light-filled, open-plan kitchen/dining/living zone with additional formal dining room adjoining. The kitchen has been fully modernised with stone-topped breakfast bar, five-burner gas stove, dishwasher and split-system air conditioner. Double glass doors open to the deck on two sides, and the back door captures colour through its stained glass.
The rear hallway hides an elegant family bathroom with claw-foot bath and separate laundry with external access.
Upstairs is another master suite featuring walk-in robe and large bathroom with corner spa and stunning stained glass windows. This private space, with split-system air conditioning, provides an ideal retreat with plenty of room for king-size bed plus lounge seating.
