AUCTION on the 6th of June at 11am (Location to be confirmed). MUST register attend & bid.
An exclusive Kings Domain setting creates an idyllic leafy context for this tastefully updated, two bedroom Art Deco apartment with a refined urban attitude. Nestled between Fawkner Park and the Botanical Gardens, this first floor home is an outstanding lifestyle abode with investment credentials that will always endure, set amidst the tree-tops and within walking distance of Toorak Rd.
Its original character and heritage remain faithfully preserved by a renovation that sees a Blanco-equipped kitchen with granite benchtops overlook the spacious yet ambient charm of a meals / living area that is warmed by a fire place (STC). Each of the bedrooms is appointed with built in robes and enjoys delightful connection to the home's leafy surrounds - one via a private balcony and the other via the building's classically curved and Deco window that creates a wonderful study nook. Polished hardwood flooring, Deco picture rails, shelving and ceiling detail combine with the contemporary bathroom to create a home of exquisitely tasteful comfort.
Run the Tan or enjoy some fresh air across the road in Fawkner Park, then enjoy the privilege of having the Botanical Hotel as your local, or wander to Toorak Rd where the selection of cafes, eateries, bars and strip shopping is iconic, plus you have the Number 8 tram within metres for easy city access.","SOLD - $818,000","2
