epping-vic-3076,203/86 Epping Road Epping VIC 3076,"A Lock-And-Leave Lifestyle Winner
Make your first step into the property market a stylish one with this contemporary two-bedroom apartment in a convenient lifestyle location.
Representing an outstanding investment or downsizing option given its low-maintenance lifestyle appeal and walking distance access to Epping North Shopping Centre, bus services, Epping Road Family Clinic and the scenic Findon Creek Trail that meanders through Dodd Park, Findon Creek Linear Park and beyond, this sensational lock-and-leave apartment is therefore perfect for a host of buyers.
High in style yet very easy to maintain, those with fashionable taste will also appreciate the chic décor of the bright and beautiful interior.
An endless stream of natural light filters through the large entertainer's terrace and into the radiant open-plan living domain, where wide timber floorboards flow underfoot, square-set high ceilings soar above and a sleek kitchen with stone surfaces and stainless steel appliances delivers a stylish cooking experience.
With two modern bathrooms on hand to service two carpeted bedrooms, there'll never be a queue outside a bathroom door, while split-system heating/cooling enhances the comfort and convenience factor.
An underground car space (plus storage cage) that leads straight to the stairwell to the apartment offers peace of mind, while convenient access to Epping Plaza Shopping Centre, Northern Hospital, sporting facilities, Epping train station and the Hume Freeway complete the appeal of this lock-and-leave lifestyle winner.","SOLD - $330,000","2
