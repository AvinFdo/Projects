Homes on corner blocks are generally popular. Options abound with this home. Currently tenanted with tenants who are happy to stay on. You might choose to add this to your portfolio or to begin one. Clifton Springs is a very affordable place to get started with your first home. Or you may be looking to downsize and looking to establish a garden. Private rear yard with new fence. Centrally heated for your comfort in winter and verandas provide the necessary shade in the summer months. Choices for sitting outside enable you to pick your spot depending on weather. Why do I live in this town? Let me tell you why, we moved to this location 30 years ago and have never looked back. Our children have enjoyed playing their sports here, we have enjoyed the many and varied options of restaurants and cafes. It is a quiet place away from the busy coastal resorts and has provided all our daily requirements, including medical, shopping, public transport etc. Demographically balanced with families and retirees it makes for a good town to belong to.","SOLD - $342,500","3

clifton-springs-vic-3222,3 Connie Street Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"'Home Beautiful'
Without hesitation I can proclaim this property is simply 'home beautiful' - boasting immaculate presentation it will appeal to buyers who only settle for the best!
Don't be fooled by its colonial influenced cottage facade; step inside and embrace the impressive high ceilings and grand proportions.
The master bedroom is simply stunning, big colonial windows perfectly frame landscaped gardens and provide an abundance of natural light.
Floor to ceiling built in robes and a walk through bathroom complete the picture.
The 'money room' of this property and personal favourite is undoubtedly the kitchen/family/meals area. An exceptionally well appointed kitchen showcases great style and is most importantly very user friendly. Once again the living area possesses big beautiful windows which perfectly frame established gardens and provide a wonderfully private casual living zone.
All the modern comforts, flawless presentation, beautifully landscaped gardens, single remote garage, additional off street parking simply make this property a stand out within the market.

clifton-springs-vic-3222,12 Gwinganna Drive Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"It's What's Behind The fence That Is Important!
This meticulously cared for home is a pleasure to inspect. Sitting behind a private facade the home is well maintained with nothing to be done. The main living area offers spacious lounge and separate formal dining. The well equipped kitchen will impress the chef of the family with loads of stage space and walk in pantry. All bedrooms are generously sized and have robes. The master bedroom has a full ensuite and a terrific walk in robe with loads of storage space. Bedroom 2 has access to the central family bathroom which effectively creates another ensuite. The home is kept comfortable all year round with central gas heating and evaporative cooling. The gardens that surround the home have been created to be easy care but are a pleasure to wander through. For the man of the house the garage will impress. Room for 2 cars plus a workshop area. There is room at the front of the property for boat or caravan storage too. An inspection of this lovely home will not disappoint.","SOLD - $435,000","3
