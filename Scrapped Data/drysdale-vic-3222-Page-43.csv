drysdale-vic-3222,2/77 Princess Street Drysdale VIC 3222,"Rise above the rest
The country lane like entrance rises toward the property, the towering gum trees enhance the character of this acreage. Alighting the steps to the elevated front porch you turn around and take in the clear 180 degree view of the surrounding farmlets, the Currawongs and Magpies provide the perfect soundtrack.
The 70s ranch style home has a large L shaped lounge off the hallway, and off to one side is the first of four bedrooms all of which have built in robes. Beside the kitchen with its original fittings, is the formal dining room, the sun filters through from the south providing a bright outlook. Past the living zone and down the passageway is the dormitory style wing with the other three bedrooms, a central bathroom and laundry; a country aspect is offered from every room.
Returning to the living zone you exit to a secure and private rear yard, perfectly safe in which children can play; or they may be drawn to the original stables on the southern boundary with ample room for hay and storage.
Sloping gently from the rear, the residence is centrally positioned on the allotment and could easily be enhanced by further addition (STCA) or add your own personal touch to make this house your home. Within walking distance of the township, primary and secondary schools, this is the perfect opportunity to enter the market with plenty of room to move and enjoy.
