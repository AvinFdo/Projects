Retaining all the character and allure of its nineteenth century origins, this captivating Victorian provides a contemporary inner-urban sanctuary of quality and privacy thanks to its open-design interior, quality enhancements and reassuringly secure surrounds. Beyond the gorgeous facade, discover a warm and inviting interior comprising a side entrance hallway complete with towering ceilings, along with two generous bedrooms (both with built-in robes and decorative fireplaces) and updated bathroom. Bathed in northerly light, the open living/dining area is further enhanced by a tastefully-appointed kitchen featuring tiled splashbacks, integrated dishwasher and stainless steel cooking appliances. Other highlights of this period prize include split-system heating and cooling for all-seasons enjoyment, solid hardwood floors, internal laundry facilities, bi-folds (from the living area) to a secluded and a sunny courtyard with extensive paving and walkway ROW at the rear. Number 96 trams (to the CBD and St Kilda Beach) virtually at your doorstep, it's also a short stroll to the buzz of Brunswick Street, Rathdowne Village cafes and shops, as well as close proximity to the area's popular schools and the open spaces of Edinburgh Gardens.
