kennington-vic-3550,3 Banksia Court Kennington VIC 3550,"Predictable Popularity
Astute investors and savvy buyers of all types would be wise to investigate this undeniably tempting property, positioned to support generations of family life. Bought as a first home, it could be extended (STCA) as family needs change, retained as a nest egg, rented out as grey nomads travel.
Highly appealing in so many ways, it also benefits buyers by being recently refurbished in its most essential space: the kitchen. Surrounded by an abundance of bench space and cabinetry, a gleaming ceramic cooktop and stainless steel oven have been installed. On the other side of the breakfast bar, a generous meals area flows through to a large open lounge.
An ensuite and bathroom with spa service 3 bedrooms, each with built-in robes and ceiling fans. Windows featuring new contemporary-style blinds are found throughout the interior. Floor heating keeps winter cosy in the living zone where an original reverse cycle split system still offers air conditioning too.
The double garage has remote-controlled roller door to front and roller door at the rear. A well-fenced backyard is covered by lawn to keep as fairly fuss-free fun for kiddies and pets to frolic upon, or treat as a canvas to plan your dream green-scape.
Popularity can be predicted by proximity to amenities within very brief walking distance. These include parks, bushland reserves, swimming pool, health and aged care services, pre- and primary schools, secondary college, university and Kennington village. It's a blue chip location for investors and home owners alike!","SOLD - $352,000","3

kennington-vic-3550,4 Park Lane Kennington VIC 3550,"PRESTIGIOUS PROPERTY WITH RESERVOIR VIEWS
This spectacular home, located in a prestigious court with views over Kennington Reservoir, has been beautifully designed to make excellent use of the approx. 1099sq m block.
The impressive entry opens onto a formal living space – making the most of those sensational views – and leads to a study (or fourth bedroom) and a substantial living, dining and kitchen space. This unique area offers two living spaces in one: with a nook ideal for a small library or lounge and private deck to one side of the room. The rest of this bright, open space is perfect for entertaining with a modern kitchen, dining and lounge all opening onto a large decked barbeque area.
Alpine ash floors set the scene for the quality fittings throughout the house including ducted heating and cooling, split systems and a vacuum system. In the kitchen you will find quality Bosch appliances including a double oven and five burner gas cooktop along with ample cupboard space.
Down the hallway, discover two more additional bedrooms, both with built-in robes and a magnificent master suite complete with walk-through robe, a private deck and a large ensuite with double vanity and a generous shower.
The main bathroom also offers two vanities, shower and a sizeable, modern freestanding bathtub. At the end of the hall is a large laundry with double built-in robes and additional cupboard space under the bench. A substantial linen cupboard is built-in to the hallway adding to the abundance of storage options. Access to the clothesline and an outside courtyard can be made via the laundry, or the three-car garage beyond.
The spotless triple garage features an additional space that is fully plumbed and fenced allowing room for a spa, bar or additional bathroom area. Finally, even more storage is available beyond the garage with a small room perfect for housing bikes, golf clubs or set up as a workshop, and this is accessible from both the driveway or rear courtyard.
The spectacular landscaping throughout the yard and the many external decked areas has clearly been well-considered offering drought-tolerant plants such as olive trees and succulents, in addition to a fully-fitted drip system for easy watering. The asphalt driveway leading from the front of the block up to the garage at the rear creates a private lane way and allows access at every level to various parts of the home.
This unique and timeless home is simply magnificent – offering privacy, luxury and so much more.","SOLD - $965,000","4

kennington-vic-3550,14 Steane Street Kennington VIC 3550,"HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER
This stylish updated home is situated on the elevated side of beautiful wide Steane Street right in the heart of Kennington. An easy walk to town and all conveniences including supermarket, Ross park, St Theresa's and Kennington primary school. The modern kitchen renovation includes a 900m electric oven, gas hotplates and range hood which opens up to the lounge and makes the kitchen, lounge and dining areas work well together. These areas are serviced by a split system for heating and cooling and have polished timber floorboards, bulkheads, timber windows and very up-do-date decor. The floors are solid as a rock as the house has been re-stumped using concrete pillars.
There are two good sized bedrooms and a renovated bathroom which has a shower over bath vanity and toilet. The laundry leads outside to a paved area where adjacent is a covered rustic urban outdoor space and plenty of privacy for that summer barbecue. There's also a second toilet and a single car garage/workshop. There is extra off-street parking for vehicles; the block has secure fencing which means you can close off front or back yards.
The list of people this would suit is too long to mention; maybe it is best to come and see this great little home in one of Bendigo's most sought-after positions for yourself.","SOLD - $306,000","2
