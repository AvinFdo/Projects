corio-vic-3214,12 Bacchus Marsh Road Corio VIC 3214,"Perfect location.
After being in the same family for 62 years this comfortable family home has held a lot of good memories.
Presenting development potential (STCA) or incredible rental opportunities are possibilities available to the lucky buyer of this light and bright three-bedroom home.
The young family and first-time buyer will see the joy in securing this 697m2 (approx.) allotment with a view of extending the home into the large backyard as the family grows (STCA) or convert into a development later by building a modern dwelling at the rear (STCA).
For those with the simple desire of moving straight in, do so with confidence thanks to the sparkling presentation and easy-care nature of the single-level layout.
All three bedrooms are of generous proportions and offer an abundance of comfort, while a large light-filled lounge on entry presents a relaxed setting to unwind with the kids complete with gas heating and air-conditioning.
That essence of comfort extends to the bright open-plan meals/kitchen, which delights with its storage space and electric oven and gas cooktop, while a central family bathroom, separate laundry & secure garage with workshop are further highlights.
Public transport is an easy walk away and with the convenience of Corio Shopping Centre across the road. North Shore train station just 10 minutes away, the Princes Highway practically at your door and local schools just moments away, why live or invest anywhere else?","SOLD - $325,000","3

This is more like a ""mini home"" rather than a townhouse. Situated on its own block with no owner's corporation it has its own street frontage and an excellent balance of house to land size. It is immaculate from top to toe, having been updated and lovingly cared for. The welcoming entry immediately says this is a home of great light and ample space. A sliding glass door gives access to a surprisingly large outdoor space that is both low maintenance and private. The kitchen is fresh and the hallway provides access to 2 brs and an internal doorway to the larger than average garage with room for storage. Located in the popular Cloverdale Estate, if you're after security, low maintenance and with no work to do at all, this is your answer.","SOLD - $330,000","2
