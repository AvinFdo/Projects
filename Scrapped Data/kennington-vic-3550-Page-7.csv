kennington-vic-3550,4/8 Clarke Street Kennington VIC 3550,"New Renovation in Top Location
Contemporary and luxurious, just having undergone a complete internal and external transformation this two bedroom unit is sure to impress.
The owners have thoughtfully included LED lighting to separate the open plan kitchen/meals and living area. The brand new kitchen is bright and airy with ample cupboards, heaps of bench space, separate pantry cupboard and new range hood. You will find the lighting scheme changes through to the living area to create a more comfortable and warm feel on new carpets.
Large windows throughout the living and bedrooms allow plenty of natural light and air flow through the unit, and there is a reverse cycle split system for extra comfort all year round.
Each of the two bedrooms have BIRs, and there is extra storage available with a convenient hallway linen cupboard. The spacious and stunning three piece bathroom is separate from the toilet and generous laundry space.
Fully fenced and secure back yard, ideal for keeping pets safe. The yard is divided to allow a concrete paved open sitting area and a lovely mulched garden area with pavers. Rear access is also available through the single semi-enclosed carport.
Kennington is such a popular area, and with a fantastic recent rental history you will be spoilt for choice with applicants should you choose to lease the property out. However, if you decide to owner occupy yourself, the friendly neighbourhood atmosphere of the complex will certainly appeal, as the unit is set back from the road.
Located only 2km from the CBD and only a short distance to Kennington Village, Strath Village and Strath Hill Shopping Complex, Kennington Reservoir and La Trobe University.","SOLD - $267,500","2

kennington-vic-3550,151 St Aidans Road Kennington VIC 3550,"A wonderful opportunity in the heart of Kennington
When opportunities present themselves like this, smack bang in the heart of prime Kennington, and offering a parcel of land measuring just under 1 acre, you need to take note!
At approx 3700m2, the property is close to Bendigo's CBD, train station, reputable primary and secondary schools, La Trobe Uni and various shopping centres.
Positioned amongst a very strong residential area with a mix of medium density housing development and established principal homes. This rare property will give any developer(s), consortiums and investment groups an opportunity to establish their skills and profession with no major risks, as the location speaks for itself.
The parcel is zoned General Residential, with two allotments on the title, and there's an unmade road/carriageway that is sited on the Eastern Boundary. There are endless options here including a medium to high density residential development, medical uses (surgery, dentist, medical complex), kindergarten, creche or similar (all STCA).
The original homestead has sat for many years and is need of a major restoration or renovation from the ground up. Dilapidated, but the heartbeat of this old relic is still beating ever so slightly for someone to take it on. The lot is quite flat and there is good access to drainage and Coliban services.
Always admired with many questions asked, be the opportunist to enquire today and start planning your next development.","SOLD - $760,000","3

kennington-vic-3550,22-24 Edwards Road Kennington VIC 3550,"ATTENTION DEVELOPERS AND INVESTORS
* As a result of a Deceased Estate, a very rare opportunity is presented for your consideration.
* Located in the Blue Chip Kennington area and only metres from schools, Latrobe University, shopping precinct, hotels, cafes and much more, this property offers a myriad of uses.
* The 1,518m² (approx.) corner block encompasses a three bedroom house that requires some work but is very liveable, a surprisingly large one bedroom brick unit and also plenty of vacant land which is accessed from Cardogen Place.
* Rental returns on the house and unit of $450 plus are expected, or simply live in the house and provide the unit for Air BNB accommodation or another family member to reside in.
* With both the house and unit being independently serviced and a sizeable block of vacant land attached, the option to subdivide (STCA) this property and either sell or further develop it, presents a great opportunity for the astute investor.
* It is very rare that such a large block of land with an instant source of income becomes available in this area. This property is very realistically priced to sell and presents an opportunity that should not be overlooked.","SOLD - $630,000","4
