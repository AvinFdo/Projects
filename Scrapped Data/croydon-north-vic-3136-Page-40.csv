croydon-north-vic-3136,21 Neuparth Road CROYDON NORTH VIC 3136,"THE RIGHT BALANCE FOR YOUR FAMILY
We challenge you to find a property in the same category and location that measures up to this exceptional family home. Beautifully cared for, positioned on a corner of a court style streetscape, opposite a park and a few footsteps to local bush land and walking tracks, families are going to love all that this home has to offer.
The gardens are just as well maintained as the inside, featuring established garden beds, a rain water tank system, covered patio and a large remote double garage.
Inside has been partially upgraded, staging a renovated en suite and kitchen, leaving some scope for the new owners to make their own mind up for the main bathroom.
There are three bedrooms with robes, as well as a study or fourth bedroom. Theyre all generous in size making sure that theres plenty of room to accommodate growing children.
Two living areas is a bonus. The lounge is elevated and positioned to take in the rolling hills of the East, and the family/meals zone connects with the kitchen making it a terrific social and casual area of play.
Attention to detail in the kitchen has made this an upgrade to take notice of. Safety, function and usability are all elements that have been perfectly implemented into the space, making it a place of retreat for those who enjoy their cooking.
Reverse style cooling, ducted heating and ducted vacuum add comfort, but its the Tasmanian Oak floors that are hidden under carpet that many will enjoy the unveiling of.
For the men, youre going to get a lot of enjoyment from the space thats under the house. A room to tinker and potter is an added bonus with this property, so too is the inclusion of a workshop or what would make an ideal wine cellar.","SOLD - $574,000","4
