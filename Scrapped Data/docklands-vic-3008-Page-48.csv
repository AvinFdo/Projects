docklands-vic-3008,307B/889 Collins Street Docklands VIC 3008,"Stunning One Bedroom with Study!
Being situated on Collins Street but also directly on the Yarra River is quite unique, not just from a Victoria Harbour point of view but from a wider Melbourne point of view and it is that location that has inspired the design of this brilliant building.
The river-inspired design is the work of acclaimed Sydney-based architect Koichi Takada, making his first foray into the Melbourne market. His northern projects include Sydney by Crown, Skye by Crown and One Central Park.
This incredibly stylish building located at 889 Collins Street is due for completion in May 2017 and would make for a solid investment or the ideal inner-city home.
Spacious, light and bright, this large one bedroom apartment offers a dedicated study area, modern finishes throughout, amazing water views and a secure car space. Other features include:
·?Spacious 62 sqm apartment
·?Multi – function study area
·?Floor to ceiling window, great view and plenty of sunshine
· Timbered floorboards in Living, dining and kitchen area
·?Carpeted bedroom with built in robes
·?Open plan living and dinning
·?Full kitchen appliances (gas cook top)
·?Air conditioning and heating
·?Podium landscaped areas
·?Indoor pool and GYM
· Security entrance/ intercom
· Within Free Tram Zone
In addition to this, extensive communal facilities will be available to residents including private dining rooms, a games and billiard room, gym, pool, spa, yoga room and smaller “pocket” lounges for residents spread throughout the development.
