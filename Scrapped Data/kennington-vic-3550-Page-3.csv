kennington-vic-3550,8 Skene Street Kennington VIC 3550,"City-fringe renovated charmer
This brilliantly located renovated 1940s bungalow offers a simple, low maintenance lifestyle for a range of buyers.
The mix of old and new has been mastered successfully with retained features including front porch entry, high decorative ceilings and cornice, picture rails, simple diamond leadlight panes to front windows, brick fireplace in the lounge and polished timber floors.
The cosy, gas-heated lounge adjoins a dining/study room while the remodelled kitchen/meals feature stainless steel cooking appliances, ample cabinetry, split system a/s and sliding door access to the alfresco deck and a Euro-style laundry cleverly concealed in the corner.
All bedrooms include ceiling fans and the updated bathroom is home to a relaxing clawfoot, slipper-style bath, shower, WC and vanity.
The low-maintenance lot approx 433m² includes garden shed, off-street parking for two vehicles and compact side gardens.
The prime position is a 5-minute walk to the CBD with schools, LaTrobe University, sporting facilities, supermarket, local Post office and public transport all close by.
With excellent tenants in place until July 2020 (and they would like to stay longer), it's the ideal investment for a growing portfolio or the perfect nest for young singles or couples ready to spread their wings and buy their first home or retirees could make it a great home base between trips.","SOLD - $380,000","3

kennington-vic-3550,20 Hewitt Avenue Kennington VIC 3550,"A SURPRISE INSIDE!
Step back in time to this retro 1960's brick home, set on a sizeable allotment and located in a sought after neighbourhood of popular Kennington. Solid as a rock and packed full of character, the home oozes potential and offers so many different options for a discerning buyer to take advantage of. Only a few minutes to central Bendigo and convenient to local shops, schools and amenities, this little ripper would make a terrific first home, value add project or sound investment
Perched back from the road on the high side of the street, the home sits to one side of the large 846m2 (approx.) allotment. Featuring a split level floor plan that has been exceptionally well maintained through the years, so many options are available to renovate, modernise, extend, or live/rent comfortably as it is. Many original features remain, including beautiful big timber windows allowing loads of natural light, stunning hardwood floors, slate tile feature wall, timber book shelves, wood heater and high ceilings with exposed beams.
Three bedrooms provide accommodation, two are fitted with built in robes whilst the spacious master at the rear has its own small ensuite featuring shower and vanity, and views of the back yard. The main bathroom has been updated and boasts shower over bath, vanity and separate toilet. The open plan part of the home encompasses the kitchen, meals and lounge room, which is a delightful space to congregate. The kitchen is original but more than serviceable for the now until its time to update, whilst the meals space overlooks a sunken lounge room below. The lounge is awash with natural light thanks to the floor to ceiling windows along the front side and at one end is a funky slate feature wall that is a throwback to a bygone era!
Outside, the sizeable allotment offers plenty of scope for future ideas. As it stands, the private and secluded yard is established, with loads of room for pets, kids and a vegie garden to thrive. However, there is so much potential for future ideas including space for extending the home, a super outdoor entertaining area, or even a swimming pool down the track? There is a good sized shed in place that has concrete floor and power, and vehicle access to the rear yard through the carport and double gates at the front
So many options and so much potential here. All the ingredients of an astute real estate acquisition are here, including location and price point. So whatever the reason for your purchase, you will be suitably rewarded!","SOLD - $399,000","3
