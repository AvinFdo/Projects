drysdale-vic-3222,152-156 Wyndham Street Drysdale VIC 3222,"Expansive Family Home With Huge Triple Garage - On A Landscaped 2 Acres!
Phone Enquiry ID:44440
An expansive family home on a superb, beautifully landscaped 2 acres (8000sqm) right in the heart of Drysdale, perfect for families of any configuration and throughout all stages of life. Just moments from all amenities, yet surrounded by other small acreages with plenty of space in between.
This beautiful, quality-built home is immaculately presented with a long list of features. An exceptional opportunity to acquire an expansive, premium home along with the relaxed, carefree country-meets-surf-coast lifestyle that only the Bellarine Peninsula can offer!
If you’ve given up hope that you’ll ever find a small, centrally located acreage with a ready-made home that can accommodate all the cars, the weekend toys and your tools, as well as enough internal living space to complement, you may have to sit down…. The home and lifestyle you’re looking for actually does exist!
Four large bedrooms, or three plus an office and two bathrooms - impressive Master suite with walk-in robe and ensuite. A beautiful timber kitchen at the heart, surrounded by extra-large formal and informal living and dining zones with north-facing windows allowing abundant natural light to trickle in.
A wide veranda skirts around three sides with beautiful rural outlooks over the gardens to the paddocks behind - and the handyman, car or watersport enthusiast will love the huge 10m x 8m triple rautomatic garage and workshop!
The location is paramount, to say the very least. Just 1km to Drysdale PO, within minutes from an array of quality schooling options, 10 minutes (10km) to Ocean Grove and Point Lonsdale’s surf beaches, 20km to Central Geelong, 15 mins to historic Queenscliff and Queenscliff-Mornington ferry.
Perhaps best of all, Melbourne professionals can say goodbye to their 2-3 hour heavy-traffic commute, and say hello to a relaxed, 12 minute country drive to the Port Phillip Ferry terminal; where they can either enjoy the glorious bay views - instead of tail lights; catch up on the latest news or get a headstart on the day’s workload!
FEATURES:
- Gas ducted heating throughout
- Split system air-conditioning
- Back-to-base security system
- 20,000ltr water tank (and connected to town water)

PRICE REDUCTION!!!........Stamped with GJ Gardner quality; this spacious and centrally located unit is sure to impress all who inspect!
Generous proportions, an abundance of natural light and quality fixtures & fittings are a consistent theme throughout. A cleverly designed floor plan offers independent living quarters; the master bedroom is set away from the additional bedrooms offering ideal guest accommodation.
This property delivers what so many units in the market are lacking; an overly generous kitchen with exceptional storage solutions. An equally generous living area simply means this property ticks all the boxes.
The outstanding location of this impressive townhouse cannot be understated with only a short walk to all that is great about Drysdale.

drysdale-vic-3222,91 Collins Street Drysdale VIC 3222,"The Land of Opportunity
This is an exclusive and limited opportunity to secure a truly charming home right in the heart of Drysdale with future subdivision potential.
Boasting an array of original features; baltic timber floors, ornate cornices, high ceilings and feature decorative ceiling plaster ensure this property will capture the attention of all those who inspect. Beautiful light and bright finishes are enhanced by an abundance of natural light from various feature windows (complete with original brass fittings).
Generous proportions are a consistent theme throughout; 2 oversized bedroom suites showcase size and scale. A 3rd bedroom offers further flexibility and scope to the floor plan.
The kitchen is a throw-back to yester year when 'practical' ruled; expansive bench space, exceptional storage solutions and a lovely outlook to a good old fashioned backyard. An informal lounge embraces a lovely northerly orientation and is bathed in filtered light.
My personal favourite room is what would have been the formal lounge. Towering high ceilings with orate cornices and dual corner set windows perfectly frame a beautiful garden setting which creates a warm, welcoming and relaxed living zone.
A double (back to back) garage with drive through access to an expansive rear yard ensures this property can cater for not only cars, boat and a caravan. A 'bessa brick' workshop is powered and secure.
As impressive as this property is to the eye, its scope and future subdivision potential is
where it really comes into its own. A land holding of approx. 1012m (20.1m frontage) - General Residential Zone lends itself to various development models (STCA).
An A1 central location ensures this property is perfectly positioned to take full advantage of the local amenities.
This property undoubtedly picks itself as an exceptional prospect in today's property market; a home for today and an exceptional investment for the future.","SOLD - $484,000","3

I have watched this character home evolve and be transformed by the current owners over many years. Now your opportunity is here to purchase and enjoy the restoration and renovation. This period home was originally built in 1938 and moved to the site from Melbourne in 2007 and many hours and days later have resulted in this amazing makeover. Many a relaxing time will be had on the elevated deck while you also enjoy a rural outlook. Step back in time with the established veggie patches on this 1226m2 (approx). A Rocking chair on the front veranda will also step you back in time. What will this lifestyle cost me? Well the home is going to Auction so it is over to you to come and inspect and form your own opinion on the value. Established in the 1840's the historic town of Drysdale still has the feel of a small country town even though development is progressing on its outskirts. We are also very proud to say we have the Heritage Bellarine Railway another historic connection, running steam train rides between Drysdale and Queenscliff. You do not miss out on the day to day amenities here. Everything you need is at your fingertips; schools, medical centres, sporting groups, restaurants, wineries, bike trail and plenty more. Come check out my town and maybe choose that back in time lifestyle.","SOLD - $530,000","3
