white-hills-vic-3550,18 Brudian Drive Strathfieldsaye VIC 3551,"AS GOOD AS BRAND NEW!
Located in popular Strathfieldsaye in a newly established boutique estate is this 6 month old family home that is ready for you to move your furniture in and call it home. With such a tight squeeze on vacant land and most builders booked out until next year, why bother with the frustration of building when you own a custom built, quality home in time for the New Year!
With that ""new home smell"" still evident throughout, the home is as good as brand new. Presented beautifully and fitted with all the modern fixtures and fittings on the inside, and fully landscaped and manicured on the outside, there is literally nothing left for you to do
The floor plan will ideally suit a young family or a retiree equally well, making it appealing to a wide range of quality home seekers! Featuring four big sized bedrooms, two with built in robes, one with walk in robe and the spacious master with walk in robe and ensuite. The family bathroom lies in close proximity to the kids/guest bedrooms, with a full sized laundry tucked away cleverly off the kitchen and a full storage room lies off the central living space. Split system heating and cooling and control the temperature, as well as ceiling fans in each bedroom. Two separate living spaces are positioned at either end of the home, allowing flexibility to cater for each householders needs. There is plenty of dining space afforded for a large table setting to house Christmas lunch at your new home this year! The galley style kitchen has all the mod cons, and plenty of room to move. There is excellent cupboard and bench space, dishwasher, and new cooking appliances!
Outside, the 603m2 (approx) corner allotment provides the all important and coveted side access from Vellore Way ideal to gain vehicle access or off street parking for a caravan or trailer. A double garage with internal access lies at the front for secure car parking. There is an existing garden shed for storage, but the space will allow you to construct a bigger shed if you desire. The space afforded on the block has been well utilised. The front and rear have been freshly turfed and gardens edged and planted leaving a relatively low maintenance yard to look after. The outdoor area will be awesome for relaxing or entertaining in the upcoming summer months.
Don't wait for land or a builder when you have everything here already waiting for you. Available in time for a new year, what a fantastic way to start it off after such a dire 2020. Call now to inspect by private appointment.","SOLD - $530,000","4
