white-hills-vic-3550,28 Woodbury Street Strathdale VIC 3550,"HOME SWEET HOME
Move-in, recline and relax there's nothing to be done here. The current owners have meticulously refreshed and renovated their home to perfection.
It sits behind a secure white picket fence with low maintenance garden beds and big front lawns for family fun and games.
The newly renovated home includes a spacious lounge with polished hardwood floors adjoining the new kitchen and ample meals area. The kitchen is equipped with stainless steel gas/electric cooking, integrated dishwasher, roll-out pantry and a handy appliance cupboard to help keep the benches uncluttered. An island bench separates the kitchen from the meals area and doubles as a breakfast bar while french doors open to a timber deck and a charming alfresco area. It's easy to envisage a long table spread for family dinners under the rambling grapevine and spreading canopy of a large tree decked with twinkling fairy lights.
Three bedrooms are grouped around the upgraded bathroom boasting 1200mm shower, bath, timber-topped vanity and WC while a versatile room off the kitchen makes a great rumpus or second living/theatre room. It's flooded with northern light and basks in winter sunshine courtesy of big windows overlooking the rear garden.
Notable extras are laundry storage, powder room, ducted heating/cooling, high-span double carport with gates to the secure backyard and garden shed.
Located in a quiet, family-friendly neighbourhood handy to schools, childcare, shops, Strathdale Community Park and public transport, this impeccably presented home oozes homely character, warmth and personal style. It's practical and perfect for a young family, first home buyer or an ideal place for retirees to rest up between trips.","SOLD - $436,500","3

As the agent with the privilege of selling this beautiful lifestyle acreage property I can say it is one of the nicest areas in Eaglehawk and Bendigo if you desire to live within minutes of the CBD. One of the few remaining acreage properties so close to town. There is a possibility that the COGB may re-assess the property at some future time for rezoning making it a good land bank property. You would need to talk with Council and undertake your own due diligence in regards to any potential rezoning (currently zoned farming).
