south-yarra-vic-3141,2/21 Rockley Road South Yarra VIC 3141,"Live or Let in this Dream Location
A rare opportunity to live or invest in one of urban Melbournes most iconic lifestyle precincts, this immaculate and maintenance-free, single bedroom apartment is nestled between the cosmopolitan action of Toorak Rd and Chapel St, as well as the waters of the Yarra River. Live the life you love or reap the rewards of an investment where the market appeal is sure to endure, near fine cafes, restaurants, bars and nightlife.
Positioned in one of South Yarras most sought-after and tree-lined streets, merely a few steps from Rockley Gardens, this is an outstanding chance to acquire a very presentable and liveable residence with scope to introduce plenty of your own style. The bathroom / laundry has been tastefully renovated with a crisp white colour palate to stand the test of time, whilst the kitchen / meals, too, is presentable, with gas cooking and scope to further update.
Freshly carpeted, the living room opens out to a largely sun-drenched and north-facing balcony, whilst the bedroom also freshly carpeted is equipped with built in robes. Carport parking and a store room are added bonuses in this thriving location, whilst split system heating and cooling promise year-round comfort.
Everything you need for you or your lucky tenants to enjoy a peaceful, tree-surrounded setting just moments from all the vibrancy, transport and easy city access for which South Yarra is famous.","SOLD - $550,000","1
