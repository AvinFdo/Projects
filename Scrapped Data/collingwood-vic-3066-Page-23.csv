collingwood-vic-3066,6 Mansard Lane Collingwood VIC 3066,"City edge significance since c1861
The surroundings of this elegant contemporary property date from c1861, when the Yorkshire Brewery was at the forefront of Collingwood's emergence as Melbourne's most important industrial quarter. Today, the area is renowned for its leading role as a residential precinct - a fact emphatically illustrated by this dynamic home and its immediate proximity to cafes, retail outlets, tram routes and the CBD. A downstairs living/dining area tells a story of style that features an undercover front terrace and an open plan Caesarstone kitchen. On the upstairs level, the luxury of the generous main bedroom is complemented by built in robes, an immaculate ensuite and a captivating balcony retreat while a pleasing sense of space defines a second bedroom with its own built in robes, served by a central second bathroom. Heating/cooling, under stairs storage and secure garaging add to the attraction of a home where convenience is key and evocative environs convey iconic inner city character.","SOLD - $750,000","2
