kennington-vic-3550,96 Neale Street KENNINGTON VIC 3550,"Classic meets modern in exceptional location
An impressive refurbishment has wholly refreshed this classic Californian bungalow, allowing it to once again extend a warm welcome to residents and visitors alike. Complemented by a wealth of original features, modern additions have been harmoniously infused to meet all expectations for modern living. Leadlight windows, timber fretwork and Baltic pine floors continue to grace the interior beneath 11 foot ceilings. Gas heating and evaporative cooling, however, are now ducted throughout for ultimate comfort. Aptly taking centre stage, a clawfoot tub stands like an elegant artwork in the bathroom. Fine provincial style cabinetry in the kitchen, topped with hardwood benches, host stainless-steel appliances. Ever emitting their inviting ambience, open fireplaces with stunning timber mantles have been retained in both the lounge and dining rooms. Three large bedrooms include main with direct bathroom access, as well as French doors to the extensive, covered and elevated rear deck. An exquisite summer oasis, the big backyard also features lofty and long-established shade trees, along with extensive red brick paving and secure fencing. Potential to sub-divide the backyard to create a unit site exists (STCA), due to the generous dimensions of the block that measures approximately 744 square metres. With the CBD, university, shopping centres, buses, schools, parks and more all an easy stroll away, you hardly need a car living here. This prized location, plus vacant possession available or the option of an excellent tenant staying on, just add to the many reasons why you need to book an inspection of this exceptional property as soon as possible.

kennington-vic-3550,8 Ridgeway Crescent KENNINGTON VIC 3550,"Quiet Location - Solid Family Home
THIS 80s-style residence has been a family home for more than 30 years, and being such a well-built and maintained property, it's sure to serve its new owner just as well.
The location is simply superb. Ridgeway Crescent is a quiet family thoroughfare just a few minutes' walk from both the university and BSE College to the south, and a similar distance to Kennington Reservoir and the shopping precinct in the east.
As an investment, this area of Bendigo is a sure bet, and when you consider that this home also has an upstairs extension with its own bathroom and private access, then the proximity to the university is even more attractive.
This very solid home is all original, and while you might want to update the dcor, the bones of this property are solid.
In the lounge room, cathedral ceilings feature, with exposed beams, a solid-brick feature wall, gas heating and an archway leading to the meals area and kitchen.
The cabinetry is all hard-wearing solid timber with updated appliances that include a Westinghouse electric wall oven, Chef gas cooktop, and an as-new Bellissimo dishwasher.
All three bedrooms have built-in wardrobes and ceiling fans, and evaporative air-conditioning is ducted throughout. A second heater at the end of the hallway keeps all the bedrooms cosy in winter.
The upstairs area also has reverse-cycle heating and cooling.
Outside is a very generous backyard with shade trees, a rainwater tank, and a steel garden shed.
A single-car garage with roller door provides secure off-street parking. The owners say the neighbours are wonderful too, which is icing on the cake at this brilliant location.","SOLD - $333,000","4

kennington-vic-3550,13 Mahon Avenue KENNINGTON VIC 3550,"QUIET STREET - RENOVATED HOME
Looking for a new angle? This home has just that point of difference to make life interesting.
Situated on a street in sought-after Kennington, this three-bedroom weatherboard takes advantage of a very gentle bend in the road to sit on the site at a slight angle.
Its floor-plan capitalises on the angles, with an L-shaped wing housing two bedrooms, both with good-sized built-in wardrobes. There's a sunny third bedroom/sunroom at the rear.
The bathroom and kitchen are recently renovated, and the house is freshly painted with new floor coverings.
The living space has been opened up to provide a good family entertainment area off the spacious kitchen. A second big living room provides flexibility, making this an adaptable home. It opens on to the sunroom through double doors.
There's a carport, through to the 10x6 lock up garage which also has power, with an under-cover barbeque area alongside.
There's nothing to do in this well-maintained home but with its flexible spaces and functional layout there's plenty of scope, too, for it to adapt.","SOLD - $295,000","3

kennington-vic-3550,7 Sternberg Street KENNINGTON VIC 3550,"Iconic California Bungalow Family Home
Only minutes to everything our beautiful city has to offer is this well admired and popular looking solid brick California Bungalow.
Sited at the foot and outskirts of Central Bendigo, on the fringe of the McIvor Road end of Sternberg Street, this truly unique family home has been loved and cared for over many years.
On an untouched genuine 1/4 acre (approx. 1009m2)block, its multipurpose potential will attract a variety of buyers.
Original in areas with loads of potential to modernise, extend or develop (STCA), the home offers 3 bedrooms and study (or formal dining) and 3 living areas.
Evident from the front portico and through the double glass doors, original features grace the home and include leadlight windows, decorative ceiling roses and cornice work, and open fire places and chimneys.
Heating and cooling is available, plus the modest kitchen overlooks an open plan meals/family room which has an outlook of the massive rear yard.
Upstairs you will find a huge loft-style rumpus room for the kids.
Outside are established and secure gardens, shedding with power and secluded alfresco areas, all so close to popular amenities.
Seize the moment and call this iconic home yours.

kennington-vic-3550,19 Glencoe Street Kennington VIC 3550,"FABULOUS LOCATION - BACKING TO KENNINGTON OVAL
Looking for a project? Then have a look at this 2 bedroom aluminium clad home, sited on approx 676 square metres, in one of the best Kennington locations.
Backing onto the Kennington Oval, one block away from St Therese's Primary School, in the zone for Bendigo South East Secondary school and a hop, skip and a jump away from the doctor and chemist.
All this adds up to an amazing location to live. So perhaps you may like to consider the idea of further subdividing (subject to council approval) and building 2 townhouses in such a handy spot.
Apart from that, the 2 bedroom home is neat and tidy, with tenants paying $250 per week.","SOLD - $247,000","2

kennington-vic-3550,30 Lowndes Street KENNINGTON VIC 3550,"This is really a No Brainer - Perfect in Every Way
Location is always a key in any Real Estate transaction, so look no further than this perfectly presented, 3 bedroom cream brick home in the heart of Kennington.
The home is quaint but also appealing in many ways, with fresh updates literally throughout the inside and the outside.
All 3 bedrooms have built-in robes and the kitchen has all mod cons including gas hot plates, electric under-bench oven, dishwasher and rangehood, plus ample cupboards and bench space.
Separate lounge with polished floorboards, ducted heating and cooling throughout and a bathroom that compliments itself in presentation.
Outside you will find a massive alfresco undercover deck area to entertain family and friends, established gardens both front and rear, great shedding with concrete floor and 3 phase power, and a double carport with freshly laid asphalt.
This lovely home is within walking distance to Bendigo's newest shopping centre Kennington Village, Strath Village, Strath Hill, schools, doctors, bus and recreational facilities. This has to be the best value in Kennington by far.

kennington-vic-3550,48 Glencoe Street KENNINGTON VIC 3550,"LOVE THE HOME AND THE LOCATION
The home was built in the 1970's, having had some changes made along the way, it is still a great a family home as it was back then! There is so much to love.

The modern kitchen is well appointed and accessed from the fantastic lounge area, with adjoining dining, plus a generous second rumpus or living area. Outside you have a stunning front deck area, with built in BBQ and sun umbrella, perfect for relaxing and entertaining. The rear yard is exciting with plenty of space, in addition to an undercover entertaining area, including another BBQ. The extra-long double garage has plenty of space for the cars plus workshop and storage.
This attractive opportunity is in an ideal location. Call today for a closer inspection as it will suit several buyers needs!
