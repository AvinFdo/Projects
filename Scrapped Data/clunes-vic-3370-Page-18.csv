This delightful home is on the north side of Clunes with only three minutes to the main street of town. On a quiet strip this extremely tidy abode has so much to offer. This three bedroom residence has been renovated and extended which is sure to please. A new kitchen is one surprise the property has to offer with modern appliances we all demand. The bathroom was wonderfully renovated last year. There is a separate dining and lounge so the residence is far larger than it appears from the road. Entertaining flows well from each room out to the pergola/bbq area. Shedding and car coverage is amply supplied with a carport and a large 9x6m garage. Sitting on an extra large allotment your family will have so much room for outdoor fun and games. At this realistic price, don't be late.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"3
