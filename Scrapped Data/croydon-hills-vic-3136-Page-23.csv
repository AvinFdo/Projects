croydon-hills-vic-3136,23 ROSEMARY AVENUE CROYDON HILLS VIC 3136,"Great Home, Great Location, Great Value
You couldn't you get a better location. Croydon Hills prides itself on being a family friendly location, having plenty of quality schools nearby (including Luther College, The Good Shepherd and Yarra Valley Grammar) and many shopping options within walking distance or a short drive away. Surrounded by a selection of parks and reserves, it shouldn't be forgotten that access to the vineyard play ground is only within 20 minutes from here!. Have you been convinced yet? Perhaps the beautifully presented 3 bedroom, plus study home will do the trick? Throughout the journey in this home you can tell it is warm, inviting and will definitely offer a real place to call home for your family. The 2 bathrooms and kitchen are still like new, while the lounge/dining and family room offer plenty of space to entertain or lounge around with the kids. Outside has a few hidden treasures of its own. There's a few peaceful sitting spots and a entertaining pergola which overlooks the secured swimming pool. New fencing on most sides of the property is a bonus, so too is the inclusion of a dishwasher, ducted heating and a double garage.
Expected rental in the vicinity of $410-$430 per week

This distinguished family home is set on a large allotment affording spacious front and rear gardens. Immaculately presented, the interior spans two levels – the bottom dedicated to informal and formal living and the top allocated to the sleeping quarters. The study may double as an additional bedroom. Slate tiles adorn the entry which leads onto the sumptuous lounge and dining rooms. From here, the light-filled kitchen (boasting electric oven, gas hot plates & an ASKO dishwasher) oversees a casual meals area adjacent a large family room. The private backyard, bordered by established plantation, is overseen by an alfresco dining and barbeque area – an ideal place for summer soirees. Immersed in natural light, the sizeable bedrooms are privy to verdant, tree-top vistas; the master benefits from an ensuite and walk-in robe. Superbly situated, the home is in walking distance of Yarra Valley Grammar and close to shops, parks and other quality schools. Features: ducted heating; evaporative cooling, abundant storage space; powder room; double garage.

croydon-hills-vic-3136,5 Handscombe Court Croydon Hills VIC 3136,"See, Stay, Love!
Upon first viewing this 3 bedroom plus study family home, you’ll want to stay; the longer you stay, the more you will love it! Set over a single level, the layout flows cohesively from one living space to another. The formal lounge/dining is the entertaining hub and is complemented by an open fireplace – an inviting place to curl up during the winter months. The study may be utilised as a home office due to its own side entrance. Overseen by a well-equipped kitchen, the casual meals and family room lead onto a long decking ideal for summer soirees. Back inside, polished boards and a soft colour palette accentuate the layout, allowing focus to turn to the majestic scenery - the kitchen, deck and family room are privy to views over the Dandenong Ranges. Gently sloping landscaped gardens mimic the surrounding undulating vistas; the tranquil river inspired theme is a textural delight that must be experienced in person to fully appreciate. Close to local shops, transport and quality schools such as Yarra Valley Grammar and Rudolf Steiner, this home is intrinsically family compatible.
