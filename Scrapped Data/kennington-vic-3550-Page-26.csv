kennington-vic-3550,25 Yallambee Drive Kennington VIC 3550,"True Gem in a Great Location
Petite white-rendered brick home has street appeal in spades with bold black and white striped awnings, colonial-style windows and gabled front portico.
But it's not just a pretty face, there's much to love inside as well with a practical layout including three bedrooms, L-shaped lounge/dining room, compact kitchen with electric cooking and plenty of storage. It's all snug and warm through winter with ducted gas heating complemented by a gas space heater in the lounge with a wall-mounted air conditioner for summer.
Walk-through laundry leads to a pretty pergola-covered deck surrounded by a garden of established trees and flowering shrubs. There's a garden shed, fernery/potting shed, veggie plot, rainwater tank and tandem carport with auto door at the front for added security.
There's much to love about this appealing home, but it's now time for new owners to add their touch to the clean and classic seventies style property.
Located in one of Kennington's best streets, it would make a great first home for young couples, an ideal smaller nest for empty-nesters or a top investment property.","SOLD - $310,000","3

kennington-vic-3550,18 Ironbark Court Kennington VIC 3550,"Entertainers Paradise
INSIDE and out there's plenty of room to relax, play and entertain at this address.
You'll be impressed by the quality of the build as well and the number of storage options. Ducted heating and cooling are in place.
Situated on an elevated 1100-square-metre block, this Federation-style home with a handful of ironbark trees standing tall in the front garden, also takes advantage of treetop views beyond.
Just inside the front door is the first of two living areas: a lounge room big enough to take a billiard table. Opposite is the main bedroom which has a cleverly concealed walk-in wardrobe and a lovely three-piece en suite.
The three remaining bedrooms have built-in wardrobes and are bright and spacious. Another room with concertina doors, presently a library, could be a study or fifth bedroom.
A lovely arched hallway, wide and long, stretches from the front door to the rear of the home where a huge living area comprising kitchen, meals and living is found.
The traditional facade conceals some modern touches, especially in the dado-walled kitchen which overlooks the meals and living areas.
Timber pantry doors open to reveal slide out drawers. There are dual Westinghouse ovens; 12-month-old granite overlay benchtops, Bosch dishwasher and five-burner gas cooktop.
Doors opening from here to alfresco entertaining and up steps to an in-ground pool which is solar heated, enhance the living space.
A three-piece bathroom and a laundry complete the layout.
An impressive double garage/workshop with lock-up roller doors has a concrete floor, power and lights and good rafter storage. There's plenty of space for parking along the driveway.
The house has solar hot water backed-up by instantaneous gas, and solar panels returning power to the grid mean potentially no bills.
Close to The Kennington Centre, Strath Hill and Strath Village shops, schools and the uni, you can't go wrong.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"4
