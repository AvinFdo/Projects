Perfectly positioned minutes from the heart of Dandenong is this beautifully maintained 3 bedroom home. Upon entering the first area you walk into your large lounge soaked with natural light. Flow through to your kitchen complete with gas cooking and a breakfast bar through to a separate meals/ second living area with huge windows and access to the lush courtyard. With an undercover patio and access to the garage as well as a shed and water tank you can't ask for much more.
