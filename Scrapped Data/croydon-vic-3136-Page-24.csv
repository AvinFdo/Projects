An urban lifestyle is one of the many benefits this charming home has to offer, positioned in Croydon Central to enjoy instant access to shops, cafes, cinemas, train station, parks and every conceivable convenience.
Step inside and be surprised by the spacious and welcoming interior showcasing strategically placed windows designed to attract natural light and afford vistas of Mt. Dandenong. A calming grey colour scheme creates a sense of sophistication in the open-plan living area, coupled with carpet underfoot which gives a homely vibe.
The spacious lounge adjoins the meals area, overseen by the well-equipped kitchen designed to cater to your everyday needs, comprising stainless steel appliances; gas oven and electric stove, in addition to a dishwasher. Ample storage space includes overhead cupboards while dark benchtops introduce an eye-catching contrast effect against the white cabinetry.
A hallway leads invitingly to both bedrooms. The well-proportioned master features a walk-in robe and well maintained ensuite-effect bathroom offering a profusion of natural light, separate bath, shower and nearby toilet. The robed second bedroom is also large and thoughtfully positioned away from the master for privacy.
This intimate and neat complex is home to four units, with other benefits including: large laundry, tiled wet areas, gas ducted heating, split system air-conditioning, roller shutter (master), double linen cupboard, remote single garage with internal access, extra parking and a private rear courtyard.
This property is positioned only a short stroll from Croydon Central, Croydon Railway Station, Croydon Park with barbeque area and playground, Sacred Heart Primary School, Swinburne TAFE, as well as being just a brief drive from Melba College, Yarra Valley Grammar, Croydon Memorial Pool, skate park, cafes and EastLink freeway.
Croydon is currently undergoing major development growth with significant spending on local infrastructure that is likely to fuel property price and rental demand. One such project is the expansion of Croydon Central, introducing a new market food hall, new essential services, additional parking, upgraded children's play equipment, undercover walkway from Croydon Railway Station in addition to twenty new town terraces.
This is a brilliant opportunity for the first-home buyer, retiree, downsizer or investor to purchase a well-presented property in the heart of Croydon.","SOLD - $560,000","2
