Experience city fringe living at its absolute finest in the form of this beautifully renovated period home situated on the doorstep of all that Bendigo has to offer! Set on an established and manageable town allotment, the premium location is a sought after luxury. Offering a short walk to and from the city centre for work, or a leisurely stroll to enjoy the city's renowned galleries, cafés, restaurants and shopping, you can simplify your lifestyle (and your carbon footprint) by enjoying the convenience of being central to everything!
The totally renovated home is a credit to the current owners, and has left nothing for the new owner to do. The renovations have been sympathetic to the era of the original home, meaning its's character and charm remain in tact. Perfect for singles, couples and young families alike, this sort of hassle-free city lifestyle is highly sought after in today's market. In very solid order, features include beautiful polished hardwood floors, high ceilings, timber windows, plenty of natural light, updated kitchen and bathrooms, new roofing, fresh painting, and split system heating and cooling to name a few.
Internally, the deceptively large floor plan boasts four carpeted bedrooms, or three plus a generous study (it's up to you?). The spacious master suite is complete with walk in robe and its own modern three piece ensuite! The main bathroom has also been fully modernised and includes shower, bath and separate toilet. The central hallway lined with gorgeous timber floors leads to the rear, and opens to the huge open plan kitchen meals and spacious living area. Lovely big windows and glass doors allow plenty of natural light. The spacious kitchen has been wonderfully renovated with all the mod cons included. Boasting expansive bench tops, up to date cooking appliances, dishwasher, and loads of cupboard space, you cant help but be impressed. The living space is light bright and airy, roomy enough for a gathering of lots of friends or family (or intimate enough for two) with fabulous sunny views to the deck area.
Outside is a good sized allotment; its size (approx 733m2) is more than generous for inner city living. With a lovely established garden and landscaped yard already in place, you won't become a slave here! The sun deck at the back door provides a great space to entertain guests and have breakfast, and it flows further into a covered and enclosed space that is perfect for the cooler months. At the rear of the covered space is a laundry, separate toilet, and a handy bike/storage room. A large garden shed is existing, with plenty of space to construct a larger shed if needed. There is a nice yard at the side, with the lawn area an ideal spot for a pool if desired. Off street parking is provided for multiple cars, including a double carport. All this behind the attractive white picket fence that everyone craves so much!
Ideally suited to those looking to experience the convenience of inner city living, you must visit this property to truly appreciate what it could offer you. It will honestly be love at first sight! Given its location and broad appeal, you had better act quick as it surely will not last long!

A typical home of its era - built to last with old school building techniques and quality products that are hard to find in modern home design. Popular cream brick veneer, terracotta tiled roof, hardwood frame, polished timber floors and concrete stumps. Yes this home is arguably as solid as it was the day it was built!

The home is positioned on a 483m2 corner lot in elevated Marshall Crescent surrounded by neat and tidy homes. It boasts a spacious lounge room on entry with mantel, gas heater, reverse-cycle split-system and polished timber floors; there is the adjacent meals area and the original but well-kept kitchen including ample cabinetry and overhead cupboards, bench-top gas hot plates and oven, double sink and a Dishlex dishwasher. To the side of the meals space is separate sunroom-come-study nook.
Three spacious bedrooms, two have built-in-robes, two have trendy corner windows and they all have polished floorboards! The family bathroom is almost original, but in great order, there's a shower, basin and separate bath.
The laundry is a good size and has a double trough; the toilet is separate.
Outside, there is the original cream brick fence, a double carport with easy parking access and lots of scope to add your own touch outside.
Position is superb, transport is handy, it is a short walk to Primary Schools, close to Kennington Village and Strath Village and five mins to Bendigo's CBD.
