Privately positioned within a small and leafy collection of just three quality homes, this exceptionally well presented, single level villa represents an astute choice for not only downsizers and first homebuyers, but also professionals and investors alike.
Enjoying street frontage and a pleasing, cream facade, the home's high ceilinged interiors, flaunting rich hardwood floors and a newly painted decor, impart a fresh and appealing impression, while the surprisingly expansive layout incorporates a large formal lounge naturally lit via north facing windows, and an open fireplace for a cosy fire on a winters evening.
The modern, well appointed kitchen, equipped with stainless-steel appliances and a dishwasher, resides centrally within the home for easy catering; overlooking both a tiled meals space, and a substantial family zone offering both secure entry from the remote garage, and sliding doors opening to the covered patio and lush, low maintenance courtyard.
In addition, three sizeable bedrooms all benefit from built-in robes and share the spotless family bathroom (with separate shower and bathtub), plus a separate toilet.
Notable highlights include gas ducted heating, air-conditioning, ceiling fans, separate laundry and security screen doors.
