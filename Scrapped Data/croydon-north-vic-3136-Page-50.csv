Resembling something straight out of a fairytale, this picturesque residence is what dreams are made of. Packed with visual appeal, the immaculately presented interior has been cleverly conceptualised to cater for the family as well as the entertainer.

Magical mountain views complement the upper level where the sleeping quarters are housed. King-sized bedrooms, equipped with built-in robes, are serviced by a gleaming bathroom with spa bath. The master bedroom boasts an ensuite and large walk-in wardrobe. Adding to the lodging options, a study on entry may double as a bedroom. Located in an idyllic court setting (in easy reach of quality schools, public transport and all necessary amenities), this magnificent home offers a lifestyle unmatched.
Features: downlights, powder room, evaporative cooling, ducted heating, ducted vacuum, alarm system (can be monitored), 2 water tanks totalling 4500 L & internal garage access.

croydon-north-vic-3136,25 LYONS ROAD CROYDON NORTH VIC 3136,"Would you renovate, or
What a chance for the keen first home buyer or builder to update and renovate a classic weatherboard home in a premium location. The years may not have been terribly kind to the home, so it's showing signs of its age, but it does have good bones to provide the perfect base to launch your project. Give it a sparkling new kitchen and bathroom, fresh paint and polish or re-carpet the floors and you're on the way there to bringing the home back to its former glory. It already features a terrific layout with 2 or 3 bedrooms, lounge with gas heater and air conditioner, family room with open fireplace, older style kitchen with adjacent meals area. Outside adds a large covered patio and barbecue area behind the home, extensive sheds and bird aviaries, rainwater tank, double garage and very large front garden. As an alternative to renovating, you could also consider the site as perfect for a new home.
