kennington-vic-3550,2/17 Claire Court Kennington VIC 3550,"Full Sized Home on Compact Block in Kennington
Idyllic' only begins to describe the location of this quality home. Towards the end of a quiet residential court and almost adjoining a recreational walkway to Mill Street, this home (along with its neighbours) knows the true meaning of house-proud street appeal.
Deceptively spacious, inside you will find three bedrooms with robes, and a generously proportioned bathroom space. The open plan living/meals area opens to the kitchen, which will cater for a family with ease. Ample bench space and cupboards, gas cooktop and a dishwasher complete the picture.
The home is serviced by ducted gas heating and ducted electric cooling, which is particularly useful on those hot and sticky summer days.
While the elevated block is a low maintenance 311m2, the landscaping is thoughtful and useful. Pedestrian access from the front yard on one side of the house, and from the single garage on the other, there is a small well-kept garden shed, tiered retaining garden beds and a grassy area that would be ample for small pets, young children or those who prefer low-maintenance gardening.
If you would like to walk, the All Seasons Resort on McIvor Road is less than 1km away, or if you head the other direction you'll find Kennington Reservoir, Woolworths, IGA, Aldi, and numerous specialty stores within walking distance.
The appeal of this home is truly universal. Perfect for retirees who are looking for high-quality, low-maintenance living, ideal for first home buyers or those looking to secure property in this sought-after suburb at an affordable price point, and appealing to investors who know there will be many tenants seeking a property like this.

kennington-vic-3550,31 Condon Street Kennington VIC 3550,"Captivating corner of Californian charm.
This classic Californian bungalow located on a prime Kennington corner lot is a fine example of why the style is currently fashionable with it's flexible floor plan and characteristic details.
Embellished with a weatherboard and roughcast exterior, it features wide eaves, broad front verandah with thick masonry piers, high gable ends with timber shingles & decorative vent, double front entry and art nouveau inspired lead light windows.
The original owner and builder was a plasterer who added some of the finest decorative ceilings and deepest cornices available along with timber fretwork to the hallway.
Still in excellent condition, the home boasts space-adding high ceilings and wide hallways along with three big bedrooms, central bathroom and spacious gas-heated lounge with supplementary split system air conditioner.
Large eat-in kitchen, upgraded some years ago, includes gas cooktop, electric wall oven and ample cabinetry with a separate laundry and toilet off the rear vestibule.
The corner lot provides easy access to a carport off Clarke Street and two original stone stables in the backyard. One has been converted to a studio/worksop (power/lights) while the second could be used as another shed or outdoor living area.
Extras include 6 solar panels, rainwater tank, garden shed and pretty gardens.
Ideally situated within a short walk to the city, university, schools, shops and public transport.
Perfect as is, but with loads of potential for future improvement, this is a must-see.","SOLD - $380,000","3

This impeccably kept Paul Gray creation is ideal if seeking a perfectly positioned, sophisticated family residence in a wide street. Located in a highly regarded, tightly-held part of the city, it's within easy walking distance of a variety of amenities. Schools, uni, sports and recreation reserves, shopping as well as medical services and even the CBD can all be reached on foot.
Fully landscaped yet low maintenance, pencil pines and box hedges formalise the gardens with vertical and lineal dimensions. Square-edge terraced retaining walls mirror the crisp architectural outline of the home's exterior to striking effect. Entirely separated and completely integrated into the external design, 2 paved outdoor living zones are equally refined.
Indoors, rich toffee-toned hardwood floors flow underfoot, contrasting with contemporary mid-grey carpets. Matching timber floating vanities and frameless screen walk-in showers feature in ensuite and bathroom with spa. Master bedroom owns enormous walk-in robe, other 2 bedrooms built-in robes, with plenty more storage plus ducted heating and cooling throughout.
Living areas are at opposite ends of the abode, one with open fire. Double doors to a study nook and a dining room open to the huge kitchen are aptly placed at the heart of the home. An immense central island harbours a wine fridge plus some of many pot drawers. Small appliance cupboards, 4-door pantry, dishwasher, ceramic cooktop and stone benchtops also impress in this high-end kitchen.
A double garage and 7.3m x 5.8m shed with rear access and water to trough await to park cars you may rarely require whilst residing at this superb address!
