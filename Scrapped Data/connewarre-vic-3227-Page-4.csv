connewarre-vic-3227,20 Staceys Road Connewarre VIC 3227,"LAKESIDE RURAL LIFESTYLE WITH UNMATCHED VIEWS
A unique mix of coastal and rural living with a view to which very few are privileged, creates a unique opportunity on this 27.46 acre (11.11 ha) hobby farm. Perched on the banks of Lake Connewarre, views of the You Yangs and lights of Geelong set a striking backdrop to the still lake waters; all this is captured from a northerly aspect in almost every room of this sprawling rural homestead, just minutes from beautiful Barwon Heads.
The property would specifically suit retiring farmers wishing to downsize to smaller grazing land or equine lovers with 4 existing holding yards and 4 electric fenced paddocks of various sizes. A 4 bay shed is fully powered with hot water shower, workshop while an old bluestone shed offers storage or tack room.
The exquisitely built, well-proportioned home is both stylish and practical offering multiple living spaces, 4 bedrooms and a dedicated study. Built to maximize views, the solid brick home provides more than just a rural retreat; a country style wraparound verandah surrounds the home with internal walls of brick and cedar and solid timber cabinetry creating a stylish and timeless interior. Formal and casual living connect, centering around an enormous kitchen linking the oversized outdoor entertaining area, while sleeping quarters are separated for zoned family living. High quality appliances (halogen and gas cooking) plus dual fridge cavity and walk in pantry provide a well-appointed kitchen sized for farm style catering, while outdoors a built in BBQ sits within a paved and covered outdoor room for entertaining.
Beautiful floor to ceiling timber bay windows capture views across the north while also allowing natural light to fill the entire home along the south. The master suite consumes one end of the home with great proportions right through to the ensuite. His and hers walk in robes, spa bath and separate toilet offer privacy and luxury. The dedicated study (close to the master) is fitted wall to wall with storage and desk space for home businesses while 3 additional large bedrooms offer well fitted robes (1 also with desk joinery). In this section, the family bathroom and laundry provide large sized wet areas with immense benches and cupboards creating good usable work space in the laundry.
Climate control within the home is well considered. A brick open fire place sits amongst the formal living and dining areas while wood heater and refrigerated air conditioning exist in the central zone. Reverse cycle split systems are also fitted to north facing bedrooms for ultimate comfort in extreme weather conditions.
A double garage attached to the home has been converted to a huge living space complete with floor to ceiling windows for a rumpus room with a view! This space can easily revert back to vehicle storage simply by removing carpet. Town water is connected to the property with 4 large tanks for additional supply and a clear water septic system running off to the surrounding grounds.
Placed only 10 minutes to some of the region's best beaches and Geelong's rapidly developing growth corridor, this property provides the perfect lifestyle retreat with space for your hobby and breathtaking views to top it off!

connewarre-vic-3227,19 Lowanna Place CONNEWARRE VIC 3227,"When is a Shed NOT a Shed?
When it is a fully serviced 3 bedroom home of course!! It may be constructed from colourbond externally but DO NOT let that fool youthis is a spin on contemporary living that you would never have dreamed possible if you could not see it for yourself; and you should do exactly that to be able to properly absorb the full extent of the clever planning that has made this so much more than just a 'temporary' home.
With the intention of living here during the construction of a grand family residence elsewhere on the 2.64 acre allotment, the current owners spared no expense nor overlooked any trivial detail in the building of what has turned out to be an amazingly architectural building in its own right. North facing highlight windows, above average specification, completely sealed internal plaster walls and ceilings plus 3 separate reverse cycle heating/cooling units all contribute to an internal climate that is welcoming at all times of the year. Combine these with funky design elements such as polished concrete floors, modern galley kitchen (complete with stainless steel appliances and rustic redgum island bench) and the vastness of the open plan living areas, (finished with feature walls and bulkheads), and you have a ready-made home that could serve you beautifully whilst you build your dream, or be, in itself, just your kind of home.
You neednt worry about any of the nasty surprises that have a habit of cropping up on these types of properties either. The certificate of Occupancy has been issued, the all-weather driveway has been constructed for longevity, the site is completely powered by a 2 phase system that services both the shed and a further home site closer to the entrance of the block, a top-of-the-range septic treatment plant with subterranean irrigation has been installed and has ample capacity to service two homes, a large number of trees have been planted, water tanks are in place plus town water is available, secure vehicle storage is sorted and you could even apply for street access to Breamlea Road if you so desired. This would make the extra short trip to the beach even shorter!! Not to mention allowing direct access to the shed if it were ever to become the base for your home business or studio.
If you like the privacy offered by the court environment though, you are still ideally located just minutes from both Torquay and Barwon Heads with Belmont and Geelong within a short ten minute drive.
Honestly, there is an opportunity here that is rare in every sense. The truly hard (and incredibly expensive) work has all been done to a very high standard meaning that the possibilities for both immediate and future use are almost limitless. Regardless of your plans, if a rural home by the sea is your idea of heavenmake an inspection of this property a priority.","SOLD - $611,500","3
