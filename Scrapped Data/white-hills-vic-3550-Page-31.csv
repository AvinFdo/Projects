white-hills-vic-3550,146 Sailors Gully Road Sailors Gully VIC 3556,"1365m2 Block Perfect For Tradies and First Home Buyers.
Sitting pretty on an enormous 1365m2 potentially sub-dividable plot (STCA) brings investment home to your back door too. But there is much more on offer at this address.
Even after renovations have refreshed several rooms, architectural details remain to enhance character. High ceilings are bordered by embellished cornices. Corner windows frame scenes of long-established trees shading fuss-free grounds. Hardwood timber is perhaps waiting to be polished beneath carpets and lino. In the lounge, the original fireplace hosts a gas heater where a gas log fire would be an ideal future update.
In the kitchen, the cook has a choice of both gas and electric cooking options. A central island is surrounded by plenty of cupboards and pantry space. In fact, loads of built-in cabinetry has been incorporated into the house, including built-in robes in 2 of the bedrooms. The immaculate bathroom has been refurbished and reverse cycle split systems are now installed.
Located about 150 metres from a primary school, it's less than 8 kilometres from Bendigo. Just 20 to 25 minutes stroll from train, shopping, hotels, banks and lakes, plus YMCA heated pool and gym also make it irresistible. Bushwalking in Whipstick State Park is a few minutes away too.
Wide verandahs, double carport, garage and big workshop in the well-fenced yard make this package even more appealing. So, what are you waiting for?","SOLD - $342,000","3
