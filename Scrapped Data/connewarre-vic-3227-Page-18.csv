connewarre-vic-3227,31 Werner Avenue Marshall VIC 3216,"Your next family home!
Heads up - you should call now to arrange your private inspection because there's a good chance someone else already has!
Whether you're looking for your first family home or deciding to upgrade, this great 4 bedroom home suits just about everyone!
Your huge master with WIR and ensuite is cleverly positioned at the front of the home, while the remaining 3 bedrooms are at the rear and share a central bathroom with separate toilet. One enjoys a view to the alfresco though so prepare for fights when it comes to room selection! Could make for a perfect home office too.
The large open plan kitchen/dining/living is just superb, and extends beautifully onto the alfresco. Entertaining family and friends over summer would be amazing in this space - let's hope we can do that this summer! A second lounge and study nook completes the kids' wing end of the house, all of which can (thank god) be closed off from the rest of the living.
Add in a decent north-facing backyard and being moments to everything like shopping and transport, this property is a no-brainer whichever way you look at it. Only question is - why are you still reading and not calling!?","SOLD - $550,000","4
