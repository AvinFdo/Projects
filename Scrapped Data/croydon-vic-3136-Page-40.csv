On a block that measures 1003m2 (approximately) the home offers you care free living with a spacious floor plan that consists of 3 really good sized robed bedrooms, the main at the front of the home is equipped with walk in robes, full ensuite, 4 built in robes and parents retreat that would be ideal as a infants room or if you needed a easy modification into a 4th bedroom, home office or study.
There are 3 fantastic large living zones that means the family can spread out and enjoy their own space. We start with the open plan lounge and dining room that takes in views to the front gardens and will be the ideal space for Mum & Dad to call their own for some quiet time away from the rest of the family. The dining space will be perfect for special occasion dinners such as Christmas day lunch or birthday celebrations.
The real hub of the home for everyday dining and living is the family meals area that is adjacent to the kitchen and has easy access to the outdoors.
At the rear you have the extra large rumpus room with cosy open fire that will be the space for the children's play area, theatre room where the family can gather for movie nights, pool room or Dad might grab it and have it as his man cave.
The centrally located kitchen is well equipped with loads of cupboards and bench space to ensure the cook of the family is a master chef for any meal occasion.
Before we taken in the outdoors, we mustn't forget other internal features which include gas ducted heating, evaporative cooling, Jetmaster open fire place, main bathroom with separate toilet, carpeted through out over hardwood timber floors, separate laundry room, heaps of storage cupboards plus light filled interiors with soft neutral colours and tones.
Moving out from the family room you will find the expansive paved patio and undercover pergola that will be spot on for family gatherings, parties, casual BBQ's, alfresco dining, cool afternoon drinks or leisurely weekend breakfasts with a coffee and the paper, all whilst being able to watch the children and pets playing safely in the secure grassed backyard.
The car accommodation is simply amazing and will be much loved by the handy person in the family. There is a large double garage with remote controlled roller door plus storage cupboards at the back. Then you have side access to the yard through double gates and undercover tandem storage for 2 extra cars, caravan, boat or trailers. And if that's not enough you have another single garage that is fitted out for a workshop with concrete floor and power.
One last feature of the home is that it is fitted out to accommodate wheelchair living, with access to the back door via ramps and there is a purpose built main bathroom.
All this is within strolling distance to Croydon central for public transport, cafes, restaurants, cinema, shopping centres, Croydon leisure centre, respected schools, parks, walking tracks and all other facilities you may need, plus Mt Dandenong Road provides you direct access to Eastland and East Link to the city or the peninsula.

croydon-vic-3136,16 Diana Street Croydon VIC 3136,"Near New Home Boasting Classic Charm
A traditional picket fence, tailored gardens and a wrap-around verandah frame this timeless home which offers the beauty of weatherboard, without the ongoing maintenance.
The 4-year-old abode boasts a generously proportioned floorplan that’s been designed with comfortable family living in mind, with a pleasing mix of formal and informal living areas on offer. At the front of the home parents can enjoy their own space; there’s a sizeable master bedroom with a walk-in robe and a private ensuite, plus a spacious living room that can be closed off courtesy of double doors.
Continuing through, you’re greeted by an expansive open plan area which is undoubtedly the hub of the home. Here a family room, dining area and a modern kitchen with profile cabinets, stainless steel appliances and a generous Butler’s pantry merge seamlessly to create a space for casual family interactions and shared time, with a rumpus room at the rear of the home providing yet further choice.
The final zone of the home boasts three extra-large robed bedrooms that share use of a sparkling modern bathroom. Outdoor time can be spent under the decked alfresco area or relaxing on the lush grassed area that’s the ideal playspace for children or animals alike.
A number of desirable extras enhance the already appealing home; these include ducted heating/refrigerated cooling, high ceilings, deep cornices, contemporary flooring, quality blinds, a 2,500-litre water tank plumbed to toilets, a storage shed, an abundance of off-street parking and a superb location amongst a range of amenities.
You’ll enjoy close proximity to local buses with rail links, a number of shopping precincts including Eastland and Burnt Bridge, popular schools plus a range of open green spaces such as Ainslie Park.
