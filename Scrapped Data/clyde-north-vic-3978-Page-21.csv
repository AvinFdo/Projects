clyde-north-vic-3978,12 Moxham Drive Clyde North VIC 3978,"** SOLD BY PAUL RINGERI **
HIGHGROVE ESTATE, CLYDE NORTH: Dressed to the nines as only a display home can be, this fine Dennis Family creation is no exception. Positioned within an ever expanding growth corridor, the lucky new purchaser can literally step into a property suitable for any growing family keen to live in the lap of luxury with every option box ticked. The Beaufort 283 is a certain addition to your viewing list if your want to forget about the time consuming and stressful building process - you can simply move in, unpack and relax!
Behind the stunning facade and perfectly manicured gardens, you will find a sun drenched floor plan with tiled living areas including the front formal lounge, an open plan family/meals area plus an adjoining rumpus/media room. The hostess kitchen is simply breath taking and is complete with dark stone bench tops offset by the mirrored glass splashbacks, upgraded Technika stainless appliances and the large walk in pantry!
Four spacious bedrooms provide ample accommodation, including the master that has a walk in wardrobe and gorgeous ensuite that matches the family bathroom and second toilet. Ducted heating and evaporative cooling increase comfort levels year round, whilst the security alarm provides added peace of mind.
Outside you have a double garage with internal access, a sensational decked alfresco together with a much larger backyard than you might be expecting to find in a modern housing estate these days. The picturesque garden setting and the care free artificial grass puts the icing on the cake!
Created by well-known developers Brown Property Group, Highgrove merges the best of traditional family living with harmonious neighbourhood planning and friendly design. With a strong emphasis on community and open spaces, Highgrove unites four precincts around a beautifully landscaped central neighbourhood park, whilst smaller parks are nestled within the heart of each precinct. These parklands will provide attractive, functional surrounds for a range of community activities, from local market days to casual sporting events, or an idyllic backdrop for a weekend picnic. Knitting these parklands and precincts together is a local recreational loop, perfect for walking, running, cycling or even rollerblading. The thoughtfully considered layout of Highgrove ensures there are plenty of opportunities to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle connected to nature and the community.
Within a short drive to freeway access and all amenities located in the townships of Berwick, Clyde and Cranbourne, this amazing opportunity is only minutes away from the popular Clyde Primary School, Casey RACE Recreation & Aquatic Centre and the Casey Indoor Sports Centre. With established shopping precincts now located in Pasadena, Selandra Rise/Cascades on Clyde and The Hunt Club, local amenities are always going to be close by whilst the recently revamped Cranbourne Park Shopping Centre also offers an abundance of funky cafes and restaurants!
If you want your family to have easy access to the very best in entertainment, education and recreation then call today before it's SELLING, SELLING ..... SOLD!
