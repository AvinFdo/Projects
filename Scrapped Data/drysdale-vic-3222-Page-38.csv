drysdale-vic-3222,83 Princess Street Drysdale VIC 3222,"Lifestyle Acre, Walk into Town
This 5 bedroom family home epitomises the lifestyle we love in semi rural Drysdale. Situated within walking distance of the township and an easy bike ride to schools, with a sense of space and room to grow the veggies and raise the chooks, this substantial steel framed BV home sits in the centre of just over an acre of land. The position of house and ample shedding has been well thought out to ensure maximum use of the area, and, if location is an important consideration in addition to size, this one really does have everything going for it!
The 20 year old colonial, ranch style home, surrounded by beautiful colorful gardens watered via several tanks, is the perfect choice for this block and has been cleverly built to capitalise on a northerly aspect. Each of the spaciously appointed rooms enjoys warm winters and cooler summers, due to the appealing wrap around verandahs and reverse cycle heating and cooling, but the real highlights of this home are undoubtedly the generous living areas incorporating formal lounge/dining and informal family/meals either side of the enormous farmhouse style kitchen. Here you will find St George appliances, masses of storage and bench space, a central island and huge walk in pantry.
With 4 full sized bedrooms plus a study or 5th bedroom, all with built in robes, the master's being walk through to the ensuite and separate wc, there is room for all the kids and a guest or two! There is a central family bathroom, second separate wc and large internal farmhouse style laundry with dual tubs, vanity basin and ample storage, specifically designed to allow for those coming in from shed or garden to clean up beforehand. When it comes to storage, it is here aplenty, double broom/utility cupboard, 2 double linen closets and then, of course, there is all that shedding.
The larger of the two has been split into individual zones including a large workshop, single garage with slab floor and roller door, and a double garage space with sliding doors. Further to this is the open machinery shed capable of housing a further 3 large vehicles. Both sheds feed into water tanks to hydrate the beautiful mix of Australian Native and English Country garden with its circular drive, water feature, fruit trees and veggie patch.
If you are looking for a well priced lifestyle move with room to enjoy your country activities and the convenience of town close by, do not miss this one!
- 4047 sqm approx.
- Walk to shopping centre and schools
- Spacious family home with beautiful gardens
- Abundant shedding

drysdale-vic-3222,45 Banks Road Drysdale VIC 3222,"The Best of Both Worlds and Water Views
With a spectacular outlook from every window in this Architectually designed home and Situated only moments from Drysdale's main shopping centre & Point Lonsdale and Ocean Grove sandy beaches is a rare opportunity to purchase 5 glorious acres in one of the most fertile areas of the Bellarine Peninsula.
Found on a beautifully quiet road surrounded by open fields this spacious home ensures that every room has a view of either the natural landscape or the panoramic vista across Port Philip Bay, Swan bay to Queenscliff and beyond. From the entry, the main lounge and dining rooms enjoy this view from full walls of windows and also boast an open fire place in the centre of the room and a fully functioning bar to one end.
The hub of the home is definitely the enormous country style, timber kitchen with walk in pantry and vintage wood stove but also contains a more modern gas cooktop and stainless steel electric oven. The open family meals and living rooms are situated here as well with further walls of glass opening onto a paved entertaining area and overlooking the property to the line of towering pine trees & wood lot to the north.
4 large sized bedrooms, (king sized master with walk in robe almost the size of a bedroom itself, and equally spacious ensuite with double vanity and shower plus separate wc, all opening onto a private courtyard fernery) lie in a wing of their own that boasts a uniquely shaped (to also capture views) rumpus room and study/fourth bedroom plus family bathroom, vast laundry, wc and additional powder room for guests.
The home is heated by solid fuel, reverse cycle heating/cooling, large open fireplace in formal lounge, woodfire canara in main living, gas heater (in the rumpus) but has been cleverly designed to capture sun in winter and remain cool in summer. Stunning slate floors and exposed timber ceilings (some cathedral), provide an ambience that is distinctly suited to the surrounds but also has the potential to be modernised for a more contemporary feel.
The property will please all members of the family with horse paddocks and stables, a triple car brick garage with ample storage and additional shedding with concrete, power and water which could be used as an additional studio, further accomodaion or work-shop shed.. Tank water services the home with an abundance of storage that has never run out even with a full household in the worst drought conditions. The established gardens and the HUGE variety of fruit treesYour dream of self sustainable living could easily become a reality here.
- 5 acres approx.
- Panoramic water views
- 33 squares of living (approx.)
