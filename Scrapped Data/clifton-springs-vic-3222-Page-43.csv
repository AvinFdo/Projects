clifton-springs-vic-3222,15 Panoramic Terrace Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"Panoramic VIEWS! Immaculate Home
The homes with the best of views tend to be tightly held. Until now. Take advantage of the opportunity to secure a beautiful home only 11 years young, immaculately finished and on a large allotment with incredible, elevated, panoramic Northern views spanning 180 degrees.
Clifton Springs is still very affordable and is the well-kept secret of the Bellarine. The location offers walking distance to the main street of Drysdale and the golf course or a short drive to a number of the Peninsula's best attractions, including award winning wineries, historical sites, great beaches, regular markets, annual events AND neighbours Queenscliff where you can jump on the ferry and enjoy a day trip on the Mornington Peninsula.
With an unassuming facade, single level from the street, the home is built over 2 stories and comprises 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 3 toilets, 2 living areas, dining, kitchen, laundry, loads of storage and much more. The main living spaces are North facing with floor to ceiling tinted windows opening out to an entertainers paradise. The large balcony/deck is under cover and takes in exquisite views to the North of Port Phillip Bay and the You Yangs. The Kitchen is centrally located, open plan to the meals area and includes a new dishwasher, plenty of bench space, pantry, breakfast bar and 900mm gas/electric stove/oven. Ducted heating and evaporative cooling control the climate all year round. The master bedroom is isolated from the living areas of the home for privacy and includes full ensuite and walk in robe.
Downstairs a large multi-purpose room could be utilized as a teenage retreat, gym, rumpus, 2nd living, guest room, art studio or whatever you desire. Additionally a large wet room has a toilet and vanity and could easily add a shower to make the downstairs suitable for independent living. Loads of storage and an oversized remote lock up 2 car garage / work shop complete the internal attributes of the home.
Outside, low maintenance established native landscapes are accompanied by raised vegetable gardens to keep the green thumb busy and more undercover areas and open spaces give the new owners a choice of places to enjoy the outdoors year round. This is a remarkably built home, well-appointed for the family and must be inspected to be appreciated. Call Dion on 0424 940 629 to arrange an inspection.","SOLD - $529,000","4
