derrimut-vic-3030,6 Walmer Road DERRIMUT VIC 3030,"SOLD BY NICK MAKROGLOU!

Accommodating the largest of homes while still leaving plenty of space for that great Australian backyard that is becoming so rare these days, build with confidence in this tightly held, owner occupied street situated right in the heart of Derrimut.","SOLD - $270,000",,Vacant land,Sold by private treaty 25 Jul 2013,"6 Walmer Road, DERRIMUT VIC 3030 was last sold in 2013.","ALL
