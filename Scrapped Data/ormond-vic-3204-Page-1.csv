Arunta c.1920 Rare Potential on a Prized Zone Streetscape
Arguably the greatest and almost certainly amongst the last, this might be the last great renovation opportunity at one of the McKinnon College Zones greatest addresses! One of just a handful of under-capitalised unrenovated homes remaining on this prized period streetscape, Arunta c.1920 has all it takes to become one of the great projects in the Zone including approx 665sqm of blue-chip land!
Be enchanted by the beauty of a well-kept façade featuring a broad verandah and distinctive shingle-topped window designthen work magic behind the scenes with four bedrooms, two bathroom areas and a grand formal lounge plus flexible open-plan kitchen-dining. Offering substantial original rooms to extend beyond, the home also retains an abundance of a restorable detail - including decorative ceilings, entry panelling and fireplaces.
Look to the past and match the neighbours with gracious family living or, perhaps, look to the future with an additional dwelling to the rear of this well-proportioned site (subject to Council). Whatever the plan, dont miss the opportunity to make your mark on one of todays best McKinnon College Zone addresses just 300m to the station and shopping strip, two blocks to Ormond Primary school and an easy walk or cycle to the College.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"3
