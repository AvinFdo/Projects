Whether you're a growing family, active grandparents or simply like your own space, you're going to love 19 Curtain Drive!
Offering a flexible floorplan, live the way you want to! The current owner's setup is 3 bedrooms with 3 living zones, but you might decide to use one of them as a fourth bedroom. Don't worry though, you won't be compromising on space - the large central kitchen/dining/living offers an abundance of room and a wood fire makes this a magical spot in the cooler months (or when Spring disappears for a few days!). The grand alfresco extends this space perfectly and makes for a great entertaining area.
The rear lounge is absolutely massive and will accommodate all of the kid's 'stuff', or a full size snooker table with loads of room around it.
The Master has a WIR and ensuite with dual vanity and is cleverly located up the front, well away from the kid's bedrooms at the rear. They share a central bathroom with separate toilet - spot on.
Solar panels will help manage your electricity costs, and a great sized shed will suit the tinkerer, motorbike rider or collector. The double garage with internal access provides easy access to the shed with a rear roller door.
