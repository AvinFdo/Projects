croydon-south-vic-3136,67 Long View Road CROYDON SOUTH VIC 3136,"A Sanctuary of Unsurpassed Magnificence on 2228sqm
Presenting a supremely functional home of visionary magnificence set upon over half an acre of exquisite gardens; where every luxury and comfort has been stylishly provided and both the lavish internal and tranquil external spaces reflect a delicate harmony of both native and Japanese inspiration.
Set well back down a long and lushly-treed, 100m long drive screening from the road, the home has been designed solely to blend with and follow the natural lay of the land creating an almost 'tree-house' effect. This artisan-created residence is in itself both a work of art and a Zen-like sanctuary where a sense of peace and utmost tranquillity is immediately apparent.
Those knowledgeable in Feng Shui will understand the meaning of welcome in the vibrant entrance, complemented with a contemporary, hardwearing marine-ply cladding and a contrasting wall of expertly set, solid sandstone blocks. This eye-catching feature continues inside, defining the lengthy hallway culminating in an immense wall of glass capturing a stunning vista. The generous use of glass continues throughout featuring impressive butt joint and immense picture windows flooding the capacious interiors in natural sun and moonlight, and providing incredible panoramic views.
Natural tones, soaring ceilings and Tasmanian Oak wide-planked floorboards grace the vast open plan meals and living space boasting feature niches and a gas log fireplace. This engaging space is conveniently overseen by the cleverly-planned Western Red Cedar kitchen segregated into two useful spaces by eye-catching 'Shoji-style' dual-sliding doors. The front 'service' area flaunting a solid granite surface and Miele dishwasher, while the rear cooking space is superbly appointed with stainless-steel surfaces, splashbacks and appliances, in addition to a separate butler's pantry with plentiful storage.
Twin sets of sliding doors allow entertaining to spill out to the central feature of the grounds - the verdant gardens with both native greenery and two cherry blossom trees, a sublime alfresco deck and slate-paved patio abounding a 'hot-springs' style spa cascading into a spectacular, Gold-award-winning free-form, salt-chlorinated swimming pool; which in turn overflows to a small trickling creek bed, all adding to the serenity of this amazing home.
Accommodation needs are also well provided with three large bedrooms including the retreat-like master bedroom, stunningly appointed with a unique, custom designed Western Red Cedar dividing wall of dual-sided storage screening plentiful fully-fitted robing, and a deluxe ensuite boasting a walk-in/walk-out shower and a deep spa bath. A large corner window enjoys views over the pool, gardens and beyond to the Dandenong Ranges adding an irresistible element to the master and making it an oasis you'll never want to leave.
Furthermore, an adjoining home office, studio or parents retreat features a private balcony, built-in robes and a wood fire heater adding a cosy ambience; while two further bedrooms, both benefitting from triple robes, and a study or fourth bedroom custom fitted with a large desk, are serviced by a light-filled family bathroom with walk-in/walk-out shower and separate bathtub.
Further notable inclusions; rooftop terrace affording incredible 360 degree views, gas ducted heating, refrigerated air-conditioning, two chic powder rooms, a large fitted laundry with drying cupboard, self-locking pool-side doors, double remote garage with internal access and a plethora of clever storage spaces.
The large versatile Pool House/bungalow is perfect for a gym or kids games room, equipped with bathroom and providing easy scope to transform into extra accommodation, all with its own private access and garden. The design impresses again with boxed veggie gardens and
garden shed tucked beautifully at the bottom end of the property.
Superbly situated within minutes to Tintern Grammar and Tinternvale Primary, Croydon Mall and Ringwood East shopping strip with rail transport, as well as further premier schools (Aquinas and Luther Colleges, Yarra Valley Grammar), and easy proximity to Eastland Shopping Centre and EastLink, delivers even greater appeal.
'Shibumi' meaning 'effortless perfection' in Japanese, aptly describes this beautiful home. Call to arrange your inspection today.
