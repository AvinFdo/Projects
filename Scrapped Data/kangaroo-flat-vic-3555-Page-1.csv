This charming weatherboard cottage is ideally positioned with all
amenities schools, supermarkets, train station, shops, banks, and
more all within easy walking distance. Located on the Melbourne side
of the city, the property has undergone a partial renovation ensuring it is
move-in ready, but with ample opportunity for a new owner to further
make the home their own.
With an abundance of original heritage features, such as high ceilings,
timber flooring, decorative cornice, picture railing and elaborate plaster
work on the ceilings, this home offers plenty of character throughout.
The front garden leads to a wide deck and the main entry. A central
hallway opens off to two bedrooms, one with built-in shelving and a
window seat, and the master with a huge walk-through robe that opens
into a two-way family bathroom. The third bedroom is found at the rear
of the home and, like the other two, is generously proportioned.
At the front of the house is the main living area. The original brick
fireplace sits behind a gas heater, and this room is light yet still cosy. At
the end of the main hallway is an open plan kitchen and dining room.
The kitchen has been completely modernised in a contemporary country
style, with white cabinets and timber benchtops suiting the era of the
build. A large butlers pantry provides additional storage and laundry
facilities. Off the dining area is the family bathroom, also recently
renovated with a freestanding bathtub and walk-in shower, and at the
rear of the home is a multi-purpose room perfect for a home office or
extra living space along with a separate toilet.
The rear door opens out to a sunny back garden where a lawn area and
brick paved courtyard provide space to relax. The long driveway runs
along the side of the house to a carport at the end of the block, offering
good off-street parking.
Additional features include:
- Gas heating in lounge
- Split system heating and cooling in main bedroom
- New bathroom and kitchen
- Modern kitchen appliances including dishwasher and 900mm
stove with five-burner gas cooktop
- Flexible floorplan
- Original character detail including high ceilings, timber flooring,
decorative cornice and ceiling roses, sash windows and picture
railing
- External roller shutters on windows
A fantastic investment property with an established history, this home is
also ideal for a buyer seeking a character build with much of the hard
work done, yet still plenty of opportunity available to add value. Close
proximity to all amenities and positioned on the Melbourne side of the
city makes this an appealing option in many ways.","SOLD - $315,000","3
