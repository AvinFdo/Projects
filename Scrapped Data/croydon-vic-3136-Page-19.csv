croydon-vic-3136,2/123 Lincoln Road Croydon VIC 3136,"EFFORTLESS, MODERN LIVING, PACKED WITH ALL THE LUXURIES
Central to Croydon and Mooroolbarks shopping and transport hubs, this intelligently designed single level residence with two bedrooms is a striking property that retirees and downsizers will love, with plenty of potential for investors and first time buyers too, designed with all the luxuries, packed in a low maintenance, modern abode.
With the addition of elite schools in the neighbouring suburbs, including Yarra Valley Grammar, Luther College and Good Shepherd Lutheran primary school, its a great proximity for hands on grandparents and for smaller families who need to consider these options now or in the future.
Floral landscaped gardens and a timeless brick create positive first impressions, with the added advantage of being set back from the road with guest parking available out the front of the property.
Inside is effortless. High ceilings create a feeling of space throughout, with the bedrooms cleverly positioned well away from the main open plan living and dining area. They both accommodate ceiling fans and robe storage; the master with a walk in robe and ensuite with dual sinks, and the second bedroom features a deep built in robe.
Together with a European laundry, a large kitchen that is well staged with Bellissimo appliances and stone bench tops, the single garage has been cleverly converted to become a third bedroom or rumpus room which has its own access into the back yard, which highlights a Merbau deck with a feature privacy screen, garden shed and a water tank.
Additional features include ducted heating and evaporative cooling.","SOLD - $631,000","2
