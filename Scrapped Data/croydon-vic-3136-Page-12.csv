croydon-vic-3136,3 Edith Avenue Croydon VIC 3136,"GORGEOUS FAMILY HOME
Quietly situated at the end of a cul-de-sac opening onto Ainslie Park, this red-brick family home enjoys a stylish modern design while retaining its traditional charm.
Upon entry, you are welcomed by a modern foyer that operates as an entertaining zone for family and friends, or can be converted into a private lounging quarters, away from the main living area nestled toward the rear.
Further down the hall is the generously sized entertaining area, privately positioned away from the rest of the house. A timber sliding door opens out to a stunning outside deck with canopy views. There is no better place to spend time with your loved ones as you celebrate your new purchase.
Deeper within this deceptively large property is the dual lounge and dining space. Freshly varnished timber floors and clean, white walls adorn each room. The skirtings and architraves betray a humble, yet elegant design found throughout the entire property. Privately positioned through a sliding door, the dining room gives way to a stylish and modern kitchen. Elegant tilework and cabinetry, with their traditional aesthetic balance well against modern appliances, including stainless steel cooktop, dishwasher, oven and grill.
The bedrooms, each coming with built in robes, are generously sized. Large windows flood each room in natural light, drawing out the natural beauty of the polished timber floors. The sleeping quarters, located along the wing of the property, are conveniently situated away from the louder areas of the household.
The main bathroom is a beautiful balance of calming whites and bold blue; gleaming white tiles and soft pastel paint. A large spa sits in the back corner, sided by a towel rail, with the heating vent intelligently placed directly below. A stand-alone shower comes with a water-smart shower head equipped.
This property occupies an almost unrivalled position, sitting adjacent the beautiful Ainslie Park. Only minutes away are the local safes and restaurants of Croydon. Only 700 metres away is the renowned Mullum Mullum Trail. This property is in the Ainslie Parklands Primary School and Melba Secondary College School Zones.","SOLD - $815,500","4

croydon-vic-3136,287 Dorset Road Croydon VIC 3136,"Luxury urban living in Croydon Central.
Peacefully concealed behind a private fence, this recently constructed brick-veneer home is imbued with unhindered style and sophistication, poised on a meticulously landscaped 626m2 (approx.) block within an ultra-convenient Croydon Central location.
Designed to immerse the occupants in luxurious and spacious living, this stunning split-level residence displays the latest quality appointments and finishes, underpinned by a merging of neutral tones, black accents and solid wormy chestnut timber floors that radiate warmth and homeliness. Furthermore, the adoption of clean contemporary lines throughout develops an impression of class and distinction - one of many appreciable benefits that sets this home apart from the norm.
With a highest priority given to ensure the home excels in relaxation and entertaining, the masterfully conceived layout affords the occupants two spacious living areas. The formal lounge achieves the feeling of comfort and liveability while the open-plan family/meals offers a dynamic, welcoming domain for family and friends with ten-foot ceilings creating a sense of space and volume. From here, the room extends outdoors to a Merbau entertaining deck overlooking the fully landscaped backyard featuring a perfectly manicured Kings Pride Buffalo lawn and an established tree providing shade.
Sleek and sublime, every inch of the state-of-the-art kitchen has been well considered, showcasing premium Smeg appliances including a 900mm stainless steel electric oven and gas stove, in addition to an integrated dishwasher. With an obvious approach to ensuring streamlined practicality is paired with luxury, other highlights include; stone benchtops, marble-look stone splashback, black tapware, pendant lighting, soft-close drawers and cupboards as well as stunning 2pac cabinetry. Lastly, tucked behind the kitchen is a semi butler's pantry offering a vast amount of storage, including a wine rack in addition to stone benchtops.
The master bedroom is generously sized and offers soul-soothing rejuvenation, beginning with a fitted walk-in robe leading into a full ensuite showcasing a frameless rain shower with double shower head, twin stone vanity, black square profile tapware, in-wall cistern, large mirror and large format floor-to-wall tiles. Three additional bedrooms are well proportioned, feature double built-in robes and share a bathroom echoing the same unrivalled modish beauty as the ensuite and incorporating a luxe walk-in rain shower, freestanding deep-soak bath, stylish stone vanity and separate toilet.
Boasting a six-star energy rating, the home immerses the occupants in a range of carefully curated inclusions, with highlights listing as; study, large tiled laundry with cupboard and bench space, Daikin inverter ducted reverse cycle air-conditioning (zoned), LED lights, double glazed windows in living areas, square set plastering, walk-in storage cupboard, double linen cupboard, solid timber stairs, quality plush carpet, privacy blinds, Colourbond roof, two water tanks totalling 5000 litres (connected to bathrooms), underfloor insulation, shed and remote-entry double garage with timber-look sectional tilt roller door as well as internal and rear access.
This property is set in an ultra-convenient location within walking distance to Croydon Central, Croydon Railway Station, Croydon Park with barbeque area and playground, Croydon Memorial Pool, bus stop, Hewish Road Child Care Centre, Ruskin Park and Croydon Primary Schools, Swinburne TAFE, as well as being just a brief drive from The Good Shepherd Primary School and EastLink freeway.
