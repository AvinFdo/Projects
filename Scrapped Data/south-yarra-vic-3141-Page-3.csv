south-yarra-vic-3141,5/252 Domain Road South Yarra VIC 3141,"The Historic ''Kingsgate'' Stables
With so many properties it is easy to feel that they can be all much the same. Occasionally a property comes along that takes you by surprise. This is one of those properties.
Australian architect Guyon Purchad (Circa 1880) designed a number of houses with the typical styles of plain red brick picturesque Gothic and fretwork gables like Kingsgate.
Secluded at the rear of this exclusive estate you will find the converted stables with elegant and beautifully proportioned rooms streaming with natural light. This generous one bedroom loft style residence with stunning architectural windows, high ceilings, and spacious open plan living/dining area is complimented by all the mod cons and a secure lock up garage.
Situated in The Kings Domain, one of Melbourne's finest locations, just steps away from the famous Royal Botanic Gardens, the sports precinct, the arts district and surrounded by Melbourne's best known cafes and restaurants.
