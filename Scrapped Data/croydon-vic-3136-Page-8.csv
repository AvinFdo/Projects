croydon-vic-3136,263 Dorset Road Croydon VIC 3136,"A CROYDON CLASSIC - CIRCA 1890 WITH DUAL RENTAL INCOME
A remarkably rare find this classic heritage property combines potential and position on 861m2 approx. allotment and comes with the added bonus of dual rental income from both the main home and rear unit. With potential to perhaps remove part of the unit at the rear (subject to council approval) and possibly develop and build a brand new street frontage home all the while keeping the original homestead to the front means builders/developers and investors could see value here. The property itself is a timeless 1890 profile with ornate rooms in the main home (facing Dorset Road) is joined by a rear one bedroom private unit out the back; both currently earning independent rental incomes. The single-level interior reveals ornate original fittings throughout including decorative high ceilings and a fire place with impressive proportions and scope to restore and allow the character to shine through with some modern trend. Included are two bedrooms with a large third bedroom or second living room at the back, a central kitchen, ensuite and family bathrooms, a rear study or utility room and an elegant front sitting/lounge room. A single carport and large garden shed/workshop are included, whilst the rear unit offers its own garden shed and carport and its own gated, private entrance (off Beryl Street) into the single bedroom with bathroom, small kitchen and living room. A particularly inspiring package for the renovator or investor.","SOLD - $655,000","4

It so easy to imagine setting up roots in this dearly loved home, conveniently located a walk away from literally all the delights and attractions of this fabulous family friendly neighbourhood.
Beyond its impeccable front garden, the dual level home's tiled entry reveals a versatile floor plan of generous dimensions incorporating a living room, sky-lit family/dining room and a spick-and-span eat-in kitchen with dishwasher and access via a rear passage to the laundry.
A wall of built-in robes is fitted in the lower-level main bedroom, which accompanies two more bedrooms on the upper level. With scope for a modern makeover, the well-maintained interior also features a family bathroom, single garage, ducted heating, heater in the living room, a split-system air conditioner and ceiling fan in the family/dining room, and a second toilet in the laundry.
Feast your eyes on the huge backyard and immediately picture the kids and family dog utilising the space to run free and kick a ball with their friends. There's also plenty of room to add onto the existing accommodation further down the track and still be left with an alluring alfresco area for entertaining excellence. (STCA).
A garden shed, workshop for the hobbyist in the family, clothesline and a long driveway for up to four cars are additional highlights.
This first-class locale in a quiet low-traffic street is less than 1km away from Croydon Primary School, Melba Secondary College, Sacred Heart Primary School, Croydon Station, bus services, Croydon Park's sports ground, playground skate park and Memorial Pool ensuring a healthy active lifestyle for all, local cafes and shops, the Post Office, personal services, Woolworths and Civic Square Shopping Centre and close to Coles, Croydon Central and the bike, walking and jogging tracks along scenic Tarralla Creek Reserve and Trail.
