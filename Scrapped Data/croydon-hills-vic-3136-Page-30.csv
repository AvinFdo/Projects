PLEASE CONTACT AGENT TO ARRANGE A PRIVATE INSPECTION
Sale by SET DATE: Tuesday 28th July at 5:00pm
This large 864m2 (approx.) corner block is occupied by a single-level residence that is in need of a little tender loving care. Big rewards are waiting for the shrewd buyer who can see the potential in renovating the existing dwelling, building a new home or perhaps developing the land and constructing units in its place (subject to council approval).
Making the most of its north-facing orientation, this spacious four-bedroom home has been thoughtfully positioned to ensure the driveway and double garage are accessible from Mirang Avenue, providing manoeuvring ease.
Beyond the solid brick exterior, the home features a comfortable lounge with natural floorboards, neutral tones and large windows inviting sunlight into the room. The family area provides a second space for relaxation, leading outdoors to an enclosed entertaining zone to expand the available living options.
Light filled, the kitchen is fitted with abundant cupboard space and comprises a 900mm dual-fuel cooker, dishwasher, breakfast bar and adjoining meals area. The tiled floor and splashback offer a practical finish while the contrast between the benchtops and cabinetry are also appreciable.
The large master features a walk-in robe and full ensuite boasting a spa and shower, quietly positioned away from the additional three robed bedrooms which are zoned together.

croydon-hills-vic-3136,68 Maidstone Street Ringwood VIC 3134,"Classic weatherboard with development potential.
Spacious, gracious and oh so sweet, this adorable weatherboard is filled with possibilities.
Positioned within a leafy street and occupying a generous 843m2 (approx.) block, this three-bedroom weatherboard residence is designed over a single-level layout and offers a comfortable home for one lucky family.
Shrewd buyers will discern the perfect opportunity to capitalise on this great location by either refurbishing the home to their own taste and style, building a new dream home or taking advantage of the property's dual-occupancy potential (subject to council approval).
Infused with a homely lived-in feel, the light-filled lounge showcases a gas heater built into the original fireplace, just begging to be restored. Creating a sense of flow and generosity of space, the floorplan places the family/dining area at the rear of the home-a comfortable room where family and friends can socialise over a meal while the wood heater creates a relaxed mood. There's also an air-conditioning unit and gas heater ensuring seasonal relief is well provided for, in addition to direct access to the back deck.
Untapped potential will inspire the keen renovator, especially in the timber kitchen, currently featuring an electric cooker and surplus storage including overhead cupboards. Furthermore, the kitchen adjoins the dining area in addition to the separate laundry for optimum convenience.
At the conclusion of a busy day, all three bedrooms feature built-in robes, including the master which offers a tranquil garden view. Additional highlights of the home include; sun-drenched bathroom, high ceiling, sash windows, single carport and garage behind gates and extra off-street parking. The large backyard is ideal for children and pets-a beautiful space to soak up from the deck.
This home is conveniently located only a short walk from Aquanation, Ringwood Soccer Ground, as well as being in close reach of Ringwood Railway Station, Ringwood Square Shopping Centre, Great Ryrie Primary School, Our Lady of Perpetual Help Primary School, Aquinas College, hospitals and bicycle tracks.
For the developer looking for their next project, investor in search of a superb property to add to their portfolio, new-home builder wanting to fulfil their dream or savvy buyer looking to renovate/extend, this classic home is filled with limitless possibilities.","SOLD - $840,000","3
