clifton-springs-vic-3222,43 Bay Shore Avenue Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"WHAT A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN
The drought has broken and this garden has benefitted from the rain. A cottage garden, relatively maintenance free. But thatâ??s not all, this home offers a feel of come in, sit and relax. The current owner has enjoyed this home but now itâ??s time for another chapter in her life. This home overlooks the Clifton Springs Golf Course. Enjoy the peace and serenity of overlooking the flowers so caringly planted for enjoyment. The floorplan of this home is functional and a good size. Whether you are looking to downsize or become a first home owner then this will tick boxes. Clifton Springs although established over forty years ago is still quite undiscovered suburb on the Bellarine Peninsula where people move in and never leave. All you require is at your fingertips whether that be schools, medical centres, bowling, fishing, netball, tennis etc. For recreation you can ride a bike or a horse along the Bellarine Rail Trail. You can enjoy food at many restaurants and cafes. The lifestyle you choose is available here.","SOLD - $345,000","3
