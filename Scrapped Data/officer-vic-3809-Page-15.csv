officer-vic-3809,1 Hibiscus Street Officer VIC 3809,"Tick All the Boxes on Hibiscus!
This modern 4 bedroom home is sure to impress!
As you walk through the front entrance youll find the first of your 3 living areas to your right. This room is as light and bright as you wish, with wooden shutters fitted to the front windows. To your left is the spacious master bedroom, with matching wooden shutter blinds on the front windows. You wont be strapped for space with the large walk in his & her robes! Then through to the ensuite where youll find stone benches, double vanity, separate toilet, and a large double shower!
The other 3 bedrooms are of generous size, complete with double built in robes, with sliding doors, and a top shelf. Each bedroom has matching holland blinds. These bedrooms are served by the main bathroom, which is modern and sleek! Theres a bath for the kids, but deep enough for mum and dad too. The shower has a large shower head, which is adjustable for all heights.
The main open area of the home showcases the modern kitchen, complete with stone bench tops, breakfast bar, ample storage, large walk in pantry with internal access from the garage, 900mm stainless steel appliances, stainless steel dishwasher, a large fridge space with plumbing and to finish it off nicely there is even a serving window to the outdoors! In the kitchen area, there is room for your dining table and lounge to keep in tune with the family feeling. The living doesnt finish there! To top it off you will be greeted with a large theatre room which can be fully closed off from the rest of the home if and when required to sit back and relax to your favourite movie.
Opening to the outdoor area is a large glass stacker sliding door, which makes the expansive space really flow. The alfresco area has a large portion undercover and some open for the nicer days. There is coloured concrete through the whole area, which allows you and the family to really spread out and entertain.
This home truly wouldnt be complete without the laundry that goes the extra mile. The laundry is spacious and open, there is a large walk in linen press with enough room to store all towels and linen for the whole house! There is built in cabinetry and an under bench washing basket already to go!
The property also has gas ducted heating throughout and a split-system in the main living area.
Last but not least, this is all situated on a 530m2 block, with a low maintenance yard, and double gates with side opening to the rear yard if you need to store the caravan or trailer?. The double car garage has a remote controlled door, and another single roller door on the back to bring items through.
