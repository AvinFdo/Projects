kennington-vic-3550,23 Townsend Street Kennington VIC 3550,"Kennington Budget Buy
Not only does this property have the classic three P's of position, position position it has three R's as well. In need of some renovation, reinvention or recycling, the two-bedroom, brick veneer townhouse has undergone some custom alterations and extensions.
Original design consisted of an open-plan kitchen, meals and living area with a bedroom opening off each end a compact combined bathroom/laundry. A rear extension includes a third bedroom, extra living space and an unfinished vestibule/entry.
The kitchen includes gas cooking, provision for dishwasher, gas heating and split system air conditioning flowing throughout the living areas.
Screened from the street by Colorbond fencing and surrounded by minimal landscaping, the block provides for off-street parking with ample room for a future carport or garage if desired.
The prime position needs no explanation. It's an easy walk to the city, Strath Village shops, LaTrobe, uni, schools and much more.
The affordable asking price is practically only land value. Don't procrastinate; this could well be the best-priced townhouse on the market in Kennington.","SOLD - $185,000","3

kennington-vic-3550,28 Mill Street Kennington VIC 3550,"Secluded Kennington Corner
One of Mill Street's hidden delights, this seventies-style residence is secluded from the outside world by a peaceful garden entry and tree-lined circular driveway where terraced gardens, a cascading water feature and a pretty lily pond add tranquil touches.
Formerly owned by a notable local artist, the home oozes character, warmth and personal style.
It offers three bedrooms, two bathrooms, bright, airy kitchen with new Miele appliances, adjoining meals/family area, formal lounge and dining rooms and a study at the foot of the stairs. Upstairs is an expansive studio featuring front balcony overlooking the garden, two walk-in storage rooms and external entrance from the side street. Possibilities for alternate uses include extra living/rumpus room or new main bedroom while the external access provides options for a home-based workplace.
Private and relaxed outdoor living areas abound under pergolas and established shade trees off the dining room or the enclosed side courtyard where a separate bungalow is perfect for teens, guests or extended family.
Added external features include double carport and garage/workshop, rainwater tanks and sprinkler system. A beautifully crafted, vine-draped stone wall enclosing the property is a work of art itself and adds to the earthiness and serenity of this one-of-kind property.","SOLD - $430,000","3

The heart of the home is occupied by a superb open fireplace, while reverse cycle air-conditioning plus ducted heating and cooling are installed for complete comfort. Wall to wall wool carpets and polished hardwood floors span generous rooms, and quality window furnishings have been custom-fitted.
Multiple zones fulfil numerous purposes, including formal as well as casual living and dining options, along with a substantial children's retreat with abundant in-built storage. A study and up to 5 bedrooms are serviced by 3 bathrooms. Granite benches host stainless steel appliances and a dishwasher in the galley-style kitchen.

A double garage secures vehicles behind an automatic roller door.
Recently repainted inside and out plus encompassed by low maintenance grounds leaves little to do but revel in sublime grandeur. A short walk to shopping centres, medical facilities, schools, university, gym, bus to CBD and Kennington Reservoir meets all family demands.
