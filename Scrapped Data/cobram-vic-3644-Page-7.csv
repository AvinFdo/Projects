This stunning 23sq federation style residence occupies a magnificent lush garden allotment of 1110sqm and is deceptive as to what is on offer from the street!

The formal living area offers seamless views of the front garden and is set in a large bay projection. To the rear of the home, the Baltic pine kitchen becomes the centrepiece and overlooks both separate meals and family areas. It offers an abundance of cupboard and bench space with gas cooktop, wall oven tower, step in pantry and dishwasher.

Externally is where the real magic happens with an outdoor entertaining area which wraps around two sides of the home with built in pizza oven and its own toilet and powder room facilities, making it ideal for those who just love to entertain. On those chilly nights you can then move into the shed that has an open fire place and the ability to open the shed up or close it off from the elements when required.
