drysdale-vic-3222,154 Murradoc Road Drysdale VIC 3222,"25 Acres
This property is just 1.2km from the centre of Drysdale and with a street frontage of 400m to Murradoc Rd. The location is just superb for an acreage property of this size. Consisting of 3 principle paddocks with approx half under a plantation of Sugar Gum Trees. Also included is a small timber cottage, the fact that the property has an existing home means that the successful purchaser can remodel or extend on a site that would allow for the most comfortable size home in the future. The sugar gum plantation will realize a financial return and I suggest anyone considering this property should look up sugar gum plantations on the internet.","SOLD - $650,000","2
