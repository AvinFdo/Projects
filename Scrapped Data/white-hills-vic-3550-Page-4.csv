white-hills-vic-3550,13 Topaz Avenue White Hills VIC 3550,"SUBURBAN RETREAT
You almost would not believe you were five minutes from Bendigo's CBD when you're looking out the to private back yard retreat from the covered alfresco space of this immaculately presented four-bedroom home in popular Peppercorn Estate.
The home looks and feels new inside, and it has a beautiful flow from the entry, past the carpeted lounge, down the wide hall to the light and bright open plan kitchen-meals-family. The floors are a quality Bamboo, there are big windows, the family room is huge and there is enough room for an eight-seat table and there is a big timber sliding door which opens to the spacious, open al-fresco space which boasts Merbau deck, gable roof and views to the immaculate back yard.
The kitchen features stone tops, a large island bench with double sink and dishwasher, walk in pantry which has been cleverly designed to access the double auto garage (great for the groceries); and all modern conveniences.
Robes feature in all three bedrooms and the large master suite boasts a walk-in-robe and en-suite with big shower, vanity unit and toilet.
There is good storage throughout, high ceilings, quality blinds and carpet, zoned ducted gas heating and evaporative cooling.
Outside there is a double auto garage and a separate secondary driveway for a caravan, work vehicle or trailer; in the yard you will find a 4m x 7m powered workshop with single roller-door and addition sundry storage shed. The yard is second-to-none with lovely green Santa Ana couch grass (it will remind you of a golf green), a mix of established fruit trees on the boundary in front of the Colorbond fences amongst other foliage. You don't feel like there are neighbours at all - it is very clever. There is separate grey water for all gardens, most of which is automated with pop-up sprinklers and drippers.
This is simply a well-though out home in a superb position close to Bendigo Creek walking track and plenty of open space fir kids; only five minutes to Bendigo's CBD and all other amenities.","SOLD - $490,000","4

white-hills-vic-3550,17 Carrington Close White Hills VIC 3550,"Easy maintenance, like new home in a quiet court and convenient location.
Phone enquiries - please quote property ID 21407
Neat 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom home with a spacious 2 car garage on 320 m2.
Carrington Close is a quiet court, only a 7 minute drive from the centre of town and 5 minutes from the hospital. The court has creek access and it's 2km to Lake Weeroona one way and 1km to the beautiful botanical gardens the other - all along the waterfront!
It's walking distance from the White Hills shops, and kids can walk along the creek to both White Hills Primary and Weeroona College without crossing a single road.
The house itself is 3 years old and like new. The master is roomy and has a generously sized walk-in-robe and en-suite.
The kitchen has ample bench space and room to move, with a walk in pantry and built in wall oven and gas stovetop.
The garage fits 2 cars comfortably with space for storage on both sides. The yard is low maintenance with a built in clothes line on the laundry side and a covered alfresco area.
We have loved living here and it is a perfect place for a small family, young couple, retirees, or people looking for an investment property.

white-hills-vic-3550,49 Raglan Street White Hills VIC 3550,"Compact and Complete
Blending character with clean, crisp lines of contemporary styling, this 3 bedroom home has been refreshed and is ready to revel in. Compact and complete, it offers a fuss-free lifestyle in close proximity to all kinds of local conveniences and attractions.
Recently repainted and featuring ducted heating and cooling, it's as warm in the winter as it is cool in the summertime. A resplendent kitchen with stainless steel oven and ceramic cooktop sit amongst loads of bench space, ample cupboards and pot-drawers. Beautiful bathroom fittings include a clawfoot slipper tub creating a surprisingly complementary contrast combined with modern vanity and tiling.
The living room is a great size at 6.2 metres long and has wide corner windows to welcome morning sunshine inside. Take advantage of the quiet street by adding green screens to the broad side patio at the entrance for a lovely outdoor living area.
Fully fenced in Colourbond panels, the property also has a small rear yard to secure pets and little people, plus off-street parking for one vehicle. But you can leave that car at home, as so much is within walking distance. Stroll to schools, college, medical practice, pharmacy, post office, hairdresser, pool, botanic gardens, pub, footy, clothing alterations, racecourse, golf, cafe, takeaway, butcher and baker. No candlestick maker, but there is a kindergarten 260 metres up the road and buses around the corner. It's only a 7 minute drive or 12 minute bike ride into the heart of the city to make life at this fabulous address even easier.
This home could potentially achieve a rental return of between $310 and $320 per week.
