cranbourne-vic-3977,74 Marylyn Place Cranbourne VIC 3977,"**SOLD BY PAUL RINGERI**
RANGEBANK ESTATE, CRANBOURNE: Loved and cared for over the years this spacious property has a distinct country feel with its extensive use of brick and timber making it feel cosy and inviting all year round.
Presented in beautiful condition throughout 74 Marylyn Place is fronted by picturesque gardens with manicured hedges and a facade boasting classic colonial bay windows. A secure roller door shields the tandem carport with an expansive concreted area following plus an additional rear set garage/workshop complete with wood heater. Measuring app. 8.3m X 4m this is a tradie's dream and would be the perfect place for the man cave!
Step inside to find a deceptively large and fully functional floorplan. Complete with a generous sunken lounge with feature stone fireplace and a separate meals zone which adjoins the oversized Blackwood timber hostess kitchen offering updated stainless steel appliances. Don't forget the open plan family area and the sensational bonus of having a huge rumpus room towards the back of the property. This is an ideal multi-purpose area suited to those with a pool table, movie buffs with a home theatre system and families needing large accommodation for the teenagers or a home based business!
There are 3 robed bedrooms including the master with a walk-in wardrobe and a modernised slate tiled ensuite with double shower that complements the renovated family bathroom with stylish freestanding bath. Don't forget the 3 toilets plus the added comfort of zoned ducted heating, a Coonara wood heater, 2 split system air-conditioners and multiple ceiling fans.
Step outside to find a vast covered entertaining area and an old school backyard with a massive mature palm tree and gated access to the parkland at the rear. There is additional storage space using the oversized garden shed (measuring app. 5m X 3.8m). Take advantage of the large land size of app. 719m2 with plenty of room for the kids and pets to play, whilst there is also ample parking space for low clearing work and recreation vehicles!
If you believe in the age old theory that a top location equals great real estate then this is an absolute must to inspect! Sensational position within walking distance to Rangebank Primary School and Kindergarten with Lawson Pool Recreation Reserve literally down the road. Close proximity to buses, Merinda Park train station and Thompson Road, which provides direct access to all of the shopping facilities on offer at the Cranbourne Home Maker Centre!
With turnover in this popular estate at an all-time low don't muck around or else you will miss out!
BOOK AN INSPECTION TODAY, IT MAY BE GONE TOMORROW (PHOTO ID REQUIRED AT OPEN FOR INSPECTIONS)!
Our floor plans are for representational purposes only and should be used as such. We accept no liability for the accuracy or details contained in our floor plans.","SOLD - $589,500","3
