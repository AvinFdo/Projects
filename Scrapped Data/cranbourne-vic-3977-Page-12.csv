cranbourne-vic-3977,19 Latrobe Street Cranbourne VIC 3977,"**UNDER OFFER / UNDER CONTRACT**
CRANBOURNE: In a central position directly opposite picturesque parkland, this impeccably presented property is nestled on a freshly landscaped block measuring some 590m2.
Ready to simply move into and enjoy or rent out with ease, the dark timber front fence further enhances the impressive street appeal complete with gorgeous colourful gardens that front the traditional brick facade and single garage.
Step inside and be greeted by matte finished timber flooring and plenty of natural light making the lounge/dining room with gas heating feel airy and spacious. Don't forget the separate meals area that adjoins the pristine kitchen with updated double wall oven.
There are 3 robed bedrooms including the master offering a walk in wardrobe and a full ensuite to match the equally as impressive family bathroom.
Added improvements include fresh paintwork, recently laid carpets, polished floorboards, updated blinds and down lights ... the list goes on!
If you love to live outdoors then 19 Latrobe Street is a certain addition to your shortlist. The backyard is a truly serene place to be with its vast decked pergola that looks out to the feature paved retreat and the lush tropical garden setting that makes you feel instantly at ease!
If you believe in the age old theory that good real estate revolves around a central location then you won't be disappointed. Within moments to Narre Warren - Cranbourne Road, providing direct access to the shopping facilities situated at Thompsons Parkway, Casey Central and the Hunt Club Village, plus South Gippsland Highway enroute to the recently revamped Cranbourne Park shopping centre. Those that don't drive can take advantage of the public transport leading to local schools, the main street and, most importantly, the Cranbourne train station!
Opportunities like this are as rare as hens teeth so don't delay!

Ducted heating, evaporative cooling and ceiling fans take you through the seasons comfortably and as you step outside you will be greeted by a single carport set behind lockable gates. Don't forget the ducted vacuuming and the private backyard with an expansive entertainment area that overlooks a pond.
If you believe in the age old theory that good real estate revolves around a central location then you won't be disappointed! Within moments of the shopping facilities situated at the recently revamped Cranbourne Park shopping centre you also have easy access to South Gippsland Highway. Those that don't drive can take full advantage of the public transport leading to the main street and, most importantly, the Cranbourne train station. You are also only a brisk walk from Cranbourne Park primary school and local parkland!
This is bound to walk out the door so don't delay!
