clayton-south-vic-3169,11 Ester Crescent CLAYTON SOUTH VIC 3169,"Family Comfort By The Park
A quiet tree-lined street and Namatjira Parkland at its backdoor are certainly a highlight of this property, but that's not all this home has to offer a family. It presents in original yet excellent condition with a warm and inviting ambience for a family to move into and enjoy, while offering fabulous potential to gradually add some modern inspiration in the generous lounge/dining, open kitchen (900mm s/s stove) & family/meals area, 3 bedrooms and study. An enclosed outdoor area is a wonderful space to entertain a large crowd, adjoining a large games room which was previously the garage. The home also provides gas heating, air-conditioner and carport, not to mention its close proximity to schools, buses, train and lively shopping strip, cafes and restaurants
