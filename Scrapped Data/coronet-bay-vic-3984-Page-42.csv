coronet-bay-vic-3984,670 Coast Road French Island VIC 3921,"DUAL OCCUPANCY or B & B OPPOSITE BEACHSIDE NATIONAL PARK
Our clients captured the feel of an outback station when they lovingly handcrafted these two adjacent homes from local materials.
An impressive long curved driveway bordered by immaculately trimmed hedges opens to a private treed garden plot offering privacy and protection to the cluster of buildings around the 2 homes. These include a 3 bay machine shed with large workshop containing a brand new 2.4 kw standalone solar power system and a separate smaller shed housing a 6.9 kva diesel backup generator. The potable water supply is provided by 20,000 gallons of rain water storage collected from all roofs.
Once a bush block, this 75 acre property now has everything you need to live independently on the Island with abundant quality bore water and irrigated watering system for crops, pasture with 2 dams fenced to 2 paddocks with shelter trees for livestock, a small orchard, large igloo style hot house, fully enclosed vegie patch and a wood lot for heating in winter.
Main dwelling has master bedroom off main living area plus 2nd bedroom, main bathroom and an open plan living area with cathedral ceilings with exposed natural timber beams.
The guests' wing provides two additional bedrooms both with en-suite and a central kitchen/living area; ideally set up as a separate bed and breakfast. The two homes are connected by a wide veranda.
Delightful outlook across your own acreage situated close to ferry opposite walking track through National Park to private beach and nothing to do but move in.
Your inspection recommended by contacting Phil Bock on 0438 497 715 who will meet you at the ferry.","SOLD - $695,000","3
