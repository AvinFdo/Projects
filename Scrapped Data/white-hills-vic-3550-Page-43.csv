white-hills-vic-3550,5 McMeeken Way Epsom VIC 3551,"Forever Young
This meticulously presented residence was built as a display home by the highly reputed Glen Loddon Homes. As builders they are renowned for quality, timeless design and fastidious craftsmanship. The family who secured this prized property from the owner-operated building company have cherished the home and are hopeful that you will now enjoy it as much as they have.
The striking street appeal here is evident in the symmetry of the two sash windows either side of the portico. The portico and double garage match the pitch of the main roof line and protrude out to give the facade a double front. These modern, clean lines, quality materials and timeless design elements are very appealing and attractive. The rendered walls enable you to change the entire look of the home with a lick of paint, as market trends or you own tastes and preferences change over time. The place is therefore effectively timeless. It's forever young!
The same is true indoors. The tasteful neutral colours and decor throughout will complement a wide range of furniture, as trends and your needs change over time. The home has been freshly painted and recarpeted in recent years. Ceiling fans and down lights have also been added and the front and rear landscaping are more recent improvements. Enjoy total comfort year round with ducted gas heating and evaporative cooling throughout.
A formal lounge ticks the (often non-negotiable) box for those looking for a home with two separate living areas, and the dining area flows beautifully to the covered alfresco. Direct access from the garage to the kitchen is a big tick too, as is the kitchen itself. It boasts incredible functionality, optimal use of space and attention to detail such as power points to the island bench and breakfast bar for stools.
You'll wonder how it is that the house is being lived in. Especially when you see the second bathroom and just how untouched it presents. Trust me, it is being lived in; the owners are just very house proud and so it still presents as the display home it first was. The main bedroom is favoured with a walk in robe and ensuite and bedrooms two and three are also well proportioned and have fitted robes.
A roller door to the back wall of the garage enables vehicle entry into the back yard, which is ideal for storing the trailer/boat/caravan off street. There is a 6x3m shed, neat raised garden beds and plenty of grassy play area for your kids, visiting grandchildren or pets. A paved sitting area extends the outdoor dining and living space of the alfresco so that you can enjoy sun or shade as you wish.
Very nearby are: Epsom Village, medical clinic, Chemist Warehouse, Woolworths, Aldi, milk bar, take-away options, and speciality stores, Bunnings, Human Mechanics gym, Bendigo Golf Club and Racecourse. Childcare centres, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools. Parks, play spaces and sporting and recreation reserves. Bendigo Botanic Gardens, Pottery, seasonal pool and Lake Weeroona. As well as the bus network and Epsom Railway station.","SOLD - $405,000","3

Lot 34 Elwood Drive | 825 m2 | $340,000
Magnificent homes already adorn the first stage of this development; the opening of the final stage offers you an opportunity to live minutes from the Bendigo city centre with a delightful National Park backdrop. Located in Strathdale off the prestigious Harley Street end of town, the ready-to-build on blocks are a must to see. Imagine waking to the sound of native birds singing in the grand tall trees of the National Park and taking a walk along the wide trail smelling the freshness of the eucalypts and admiring the native animal life. All while having the security of knowing your block has a low BAL. If this is not enough, take a short stroll down the road and you will be at picturesque Kennington Reservoir and a little further to Beischer Park where you will find soccer grounds, netball courts, a playground and parkland.
Elwood Drive certainly offers the astute buyer a chance to live in one of Bendigos best locations. With two well established shopping centres in Strathdale, a State Primary School, a Private School, a Kindergarten and Day Care, and many sporting facilities so close, you could walk to any facility that you might need. Public transport is very handy and the city centre is only minutes away.

This property is made for those people wanting a tree-change or a property where they can pursue some limited agricultural pursuits to encourage the land to continue to be people friendly.
It lends itself to lavender farming or olive growing. There is plenty of land around the family sized 4 bedroom house that can be continued to be developed as mainly a native garden to encourage the native fauna and a host of different birds.
Inside this steel framed home are 4 bedrooms of good size and a study.
There are two living rooms and a Shaker style kitchen with a huge dining area.
Also in this room is a wood fired stove for heating with comfy chairs to relax in on those cool wet days that can happen in winter.
The internal house is serviced by a built in ducted heating and cooling system to ensure your comfort all year round.
The house has had all older draperies removed and they are replaced by pull down blinds to control the heat etc; this makes the house suitable for those with breathing problems.
