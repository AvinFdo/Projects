Embraced by parkland in a peaceful locale stands this generously proportioned yet low-maintenance two-bedroom home, which offers outstanding value for the first-time buyer, empty nester or astute investor.
With the green expanses of Shaftesbury Drive Reserve, Maserati Park and Lancia Park just footsteps away, it's a location that encourages a fit and active lifestyle. And when you factor in the close proximity of Epping North Shopping Centre, Epping Plaza, excellent local schools, Epping train station, bus services, the Metropolitan Ring Road/Hume Freeway and the Northern Hospital, it's also a location that delivers a superior level of convenience.
Complementing the coveted location is this superbly styled single-level urban sanctuary, hallmarked by its contemporary presentation, light-filled nature and carefree low-maintenance design.
A radiant open-plan living domain excites with its impressive size and scale, as does the modern kitchen, which flaunts generous bench and storage space, quality stainless steel appliances and pristine presentation.
Both bedrooms are of generous proportions (master bedroom with direct access to a sleek two-way bathroom), while a low-maintenance rear yard, separate laundry, split-system cooling, ducted heating, plenty of storage space and a single garage with internal access adds another layer of positive appeal.","SOLD - $428,000","2
