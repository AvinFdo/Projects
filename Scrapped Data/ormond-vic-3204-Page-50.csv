ormond-vic-3204,38 Studley Road Brighton East VIC 3187,"Poolside Living & a Parkside Panorama
INSPECTION BY APPOINTMENT - PLEASE CONTACT AGENT
A unique lifestyle opportunity in a panoramic parkside position, this sun-bathed property is one of only three homes with due-north direct-frontage to Dendy Park and arguably the one with the best parkland view.
Taking a unique outlook on the parklands with gracious formal living-dining and a pool-side family zone, this versatile five bedroom, three bathroom home shines with a light-filled skylit first-floor lounge and offers brilliant accommodation with a ground-floor suite plus a full-width master-domain with park-view study/retreat.
With scope for a fifth bedroom in a well-positioned home-office, and potential for independent living with a bonus wet-bar/kitchenette, this classic home comes prepared to adapt to family life with a quality appliance kitchen (with Bosch dishwasher) and elegant bathrooms (two with ensuite-access). Appointed for easy living with hydronic heating plus reverse-cycle air-conditioning, there are clever family comforts too; including a ducted vacuum system, hydronic drying-rack, and built-in robes plus roof-storage.
With a covered entertaining area beside the glass-fenced pool, and plentiful parking on a deep drive to the double garage, this panorama-view property has the ideal blend of garden privacy and seamless access to Baysides biggest and best-resourced backyard.
But its not just the direct access to the sports fields, running tracks, outdoor gym and playgrounds of Dendy Park that make his high-activity home such a lifestyle opportunity. With a local shopping strip at the end of the street, the station within a walk, and Haileybury and St Leonards Colleges, Kostka Hall and Brighton beach just down South Rd, this is the ultimate location for poolside parkside family life.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"5

ormond-vic-3204,130A Jasper Road Bentleigh VIC 3204,"Remarkable Family Proportions with Parkland Views
Impressively-sized to reveal up to five bedrooms and your choice of either two or three lofty living zones, this state-of-the-art, executive-style townhouse is an uplifting surprise within close proximity to one of the most sought-after secondary schools in Victoria, McKinnon Secondary College. Flawlessly presented in as new condition, this is a rare opportunity to acquire a home of timeless elegance, just metres from Centre Rd's thriving shopping strip and, of course, within the boundaries for one of the most sought-after secondary schools in Victoria.
A wide-reaching space with an easy al fresco flow to a broad entertainers' deck, the kitchen / dining / living is superbly arranged around a central island bench that provides you with a wonderful place to gather with friends or family, while the calming elevated views across recreational parkland at the rear will never be lost to development. Meanwhile, stone bench tops, stainless steel appliances, volumes of soft close cabinetry and a huge pantry cater beautifully to the needs of gourmet cooks.
Upstairs, parents will relish the sanctuary of a vast master bedroom in which walk-in robes, a balcony and an ensuite offer an indulgent sense of retreat, whilst another two bedrooms are also appointed with built-in robes. Importantly, there is a room for walk-in robes in the downstairs bedroom and the fifth bedroom enjoys the privilege of a vast balcony. Designed for families, the central bathroom features an independent bath and shower; indeed, both the bathroom and the ensuite are particularly vogue with frameless-screened showers and floating wall-mounted vanities.
Additional highlights include a separate lounge room, a powder room, generous under-house storage accessed via the pantry, plus ducted heating throughout, refrigerated cooling, secure video entry and the convenience of a lock-up garage that offers direct internal access to the main home as well a driveway parking with a highly convenient turntable.
