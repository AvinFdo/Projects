clunes-vic-3370,28 Cambridge Street Creswick VIC 3363,"Functional, spacious, peaceful
On a large block in a very well-established part of Creswick stands this magnificent 4 bedroom family-friendly home and it is now waiting for a new owner.
From such a beautiful street-scape, the welcoming front entrance brings you into the lounge room, study, through to the living room at the rear of the home - or it could direct you to the privacy of the bedrooms upstairs; either way, it’s a functional hub of the home and fills with intrigue at what comes next!
The open kitchen, living, dining area has beautiful views across the decking into the yard below, while adjacent to this living space is a large laundry with extra shower and toilet.
NBN is connected to the home via fibre (FTPP), which ensures a faster and more reliable service; certainly making working from home a worthy option.
Another surprise element to the home is the particularly spacious and secluded family/rumpus room at the front of the home. Complete with gas log fire, carpeted floors and a homely ambience, this area will be a real plus for the growing family.
The home captures the morning sun through its large east-facing windows which raises not only the winter temperature but also increases the ambient light throughout the home.
Only one street back from the main CBD of Creswick, the home retains a peaceful ambience and makes an ideal residence for the family seeking to upgrade or live the peaceful life in a beautiful regional Victorian town, so we encourage your early inspection of this stand out property.","SOLD - $369,000","4
