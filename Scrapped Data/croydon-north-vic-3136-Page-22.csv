The real hub of the home for everyday living and dining is the family meals area that is adjacent to the kitchen and overlooks the backyard and entertaining area.
The centrally located kitchen is well equipped with stainless steel appliances, dishwasher plus plenty of bench and cupboard space to ensure the chef of the family makes their kitchen rule for any meal occasion.
Before we take in the outdoors we mustn't forget other internal features which include gas ducted heating, split system air conditioning, wood fire, main bathroom with separate toilet, separate laundry room with cupboards and bench space plus light filled interiors with soft subtle colours and tones.
Moving out from the family room you will find the undercover entertaining area which will be the ideal spot for family gatherings, parties, casual BBQ's, alfresco dining or leisurely weekend breakfasts with a coffee and the paper.
The flat backyard is spacious and surrounded by beautiful established gardens for the avid green thumb of the family.
Car accommodation is well taken care of in the large double garage that has remote controlled door, plus the added bonus of through access to the backyard for off road storage of a caravan, boat or trailer.
There are energy and environmental savings in place with solar panels on the roof, water tanks for gardens and gutter guard.
All this is within a short distance to Croydon central for shopping, restaurants, cafes, public transport, schools, parks, walking tracks and all other amenities you may need.
A peaceful and relaxing lifestyle will begin when you book your viewing today.","SOLD - $650,000","3
