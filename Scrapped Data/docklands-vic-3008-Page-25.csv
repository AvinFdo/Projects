docklands-vic-3008,1020/60 Siddeley Street Docklands VIC 3008,"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!
Meticulous fully-furnished apartment in the Flinders Wharf building.
With sweeping views up the Yarra River, sitting directly opposite the Melbourne Exhibition Centre, and amongst the bustling and vibrant bars and restaurants of South Wharf, is this fully furnished apartment.
With two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and an open living area, this recently updated apartment offers the keen investor the best of all options – either move right in and enjoy, rent it out to a long-term tenant, or continue it as a short-stay option, but having personal access when you need.
Currently managed on-site for short stays, the apartment is maintained in meticulous order and provides the current owners a better rental return than a permanent tenant whilst allowing them access to enjoy all Melbourne has to offer.
Step from the front door of the building directly onto the South Wharf boardwalk, and you are within an easy stroll to the DFO, Casino, Southbank, South Melbourne Markets, city centre, Etihad and the free city tram circuit.
Tastefully furnished in a modern contemporary style, the apartment has a King bed (in the master suite) and a Queen bed (in the guest room), with both able to be split into single bed options. The apartment is fully equipped with new stainless steel fridge and dishwasher, washer/drier, Smart TV, leather sofas and all kitchen requirements.
The apartment comes with a secure parking bay inside the building.
This is a rare opportunity to purchase a walk-in/walk-out apartment in one of Melbourne’s most sought-after buildings. Building amenities include gym, swimming pool, sauna and spa.
The current owners are only selling now due to relocating interstate and not using the apartment as often as originally anticipated. This is a private sale.
