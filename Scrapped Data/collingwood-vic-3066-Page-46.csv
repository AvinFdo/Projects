collingwood-vic-3066,9 Alexander Street COLLINGWOOD VIC 3066,"HUGE PRICE REDUCTION
This carefully renovated four bedroom balcony terrace fuses period grace with all the essentials for today’s living. Its pedimented tuckpoint façade and delicate iron lacework give instant street appeal. A wide hallway floored in gleaming jarrah opens to a bedroom with marble overmantel, deep cornice work and built-in wardrobes. Similar period detail graces the formal dining room, which has a window to a central light well. Past the timber balustraded staircase is a powder room/ laundry, before the hall opens out to a well proportioned living room, overlooked on one side by a well-equipped kitchen (granite benchtops, Bosch appliances) and opening through a wall of multifold doors to a landscaped courtyard and barbecue area.
At the front of the upper storey are two further double bedrooms, both with quality built-in wardrobes. The gracious main bedroom has full-length windows to the balcony. To the rear are a porcelain-tiled bathroom with spa bath and separate shower, and a fourth bedroom with views across Fitzroy to the CBD. Featuring split-system airconditioning, alarm system and generous storage, this welcoming property is well located close to Brunswick Street, the Darling Gardens and is within the catchment area for Clifton Hill (Gold Street).

collingwood-vic-3066,39 Ballarat Street COLLINGWOOD VIC 3066,"SUPERBLY RENOVATED FOR FAMILY LIVING
This wide block-fronted Victorian residence is truly one-of-a- kind, offering the space associated with large suburban houses on an impressive city-edge garden allotment (390 sq.m. approx) in a quiet cul de sac close to Brunswick Street cafes, Gold St Primary School and transport.
‘Everton’, an unusually wide property for this location, presents a pleasing face to the street, with its deep lace-trimmed verandah set behind a rose-planted garden. Opening from a broad central hallway are four sunny double bedrooms (two with open fireplaces and ornate faux-marble overmantles), and a smart tiled bathroom suite comprising separate bath, shower, WC and a full European laundry. The kitchen, splendidly equipped with quality stainless steel appliances, pantry and Caesarstone benches, is separated by an island bench/breakfast bar from the vast open plan living and dining area, flooded with light from three sides. Beneath the floor is a room-sized wine cellar and storage room. A wall of multifold doors opens out to an extensive paved outdoor entertaining area and a wide lawn to the south. To the other side of the house are a garden storage shed and a 2500 litre irrigation tank.
Period charm and contemporary comfort meet harmoniously in this welcoming house, whose features include polished jarrah floors, generous bedroom storage, hydronic heating, split-system airconditioning, alarm and 3-zone sound system. Ample off-street parking is a further attraction. See this one and be delighted!

collingwood-vic-3066,233/3 Hoddle Street Collingwood VIC 3066,"Vendor Says Sell!
It's hard to find a property that cancels all doubt, stands out from the rest and ticks all the boxes. On your list of ideal properties, I imagine you want heaps of space, an outdoor area with lots of sunlight, two bathrooms and if possible you'd like two cars spaces. You probably hope the property has storage as well. Are you a dreamer, or just optimistic?
Well, the search may be over. Don't miss the best in block here in Collingwood that delivers everything you could want in a city pad or a secure investment. With a split-level warehouse style that presents vaulted ceilings and a vast open-plan living, you'll be impressed to see a private sun-drenched terrace with city views on the list too.
Walk down the stairs to the huge lower level and you meet the enormous climate controlled master bedroom with en-suite plus built in robes. You'll find the stylish central bathroom that allows the large second bedroom their own space and all the privacy your modern family deserves.
So....let's recap shall we; Two bedrooms, two bathrooms, two levels, outdoor terrace with city views, public transport, two cars and storage. Surely you have to check this out for yourself.
Please leave a phone number and email for a prompt response. We look forward to seeing you there!",SOLD - Price Withheld,"2

collingwood-vic-3066,13 Forest Street COLLINGWOOD VIC 3066,"VICTORIAN FACE, CONTEMPORARY SPACE
The traditional lace-trimmed façade of this pretty Victorian terrace gives no clue to the transformation which has taken place within; meticulously rebuilt for low-maintenance living, the house offers exceptional space and comfort. An unusually long triple-arched hallway with skylights and richly polished floorboards opens to three double bedrooms (all with open fireplaces flanked by new built-in wardrobes), a fitted study and a tiled powder room; the bedrooms and study all have excellent natural light from a north-facing paved courtyard. To the rear are a generous living and dining area with doors to the courtyard, a smartly fitted kitchen with quality cabinetry, and a mosaic-tiled spa bathroom and separate laundry. Including secure off-street parking, period detail, alarm, reverse-cycle airconditioning and premium fittings, this bright and welcoming property is well-located close to transport, cafes and freeway access.

collingwood-vic-3066,4/18-22 Islington Street COLLINGWOOD VIC 3066,"ULTRA SPACIOUS, STRONG CONTEMPORARY LINES
In an exclusive small development just off Victoria Parade, this striking new town residence offers all that is best in low-maintenance inner city living – great design, abundant light, four bedrooms and study, security, and meticulous attention to detail throughout! Secure entry from the quiet end of Islington Street is to a lobby, opening to a bedroom, with a wall of glass to the front garden – this light-filled space might be used as a home office then into a remote-entry dual garage with laundry facilities. A metal-balustered staircase leads to the central level, where a gallery links a large bedroom with fully-tiled ensuite and walk-in wardrobe to a further bedroom (BIRs), a study, and a well-fitted tiled bathroom.
On the upper level, a vast timber-floored living and dining area flows to a balcony with breathtaking 180 degree city views. The designer standard kitchen is equipped with Blanco appliances, timber finish cabinetry and Caesarstone benches. The fourth large bedroom, with city views, adjoins a powder room.
Close to East Melbourne parks, tram and rail connections and major sporting venues, this exceptional property features airconditioning and premium fittings and finishes. A must-see!
