cockatoo-vic-3781,14 Kilvington Drive Emerald VIC 3782,"The Heart of Emerald at your Doorstep
This characterful double-story weatherboard with 6 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms is one of the few original buildings in Emerald and dates back to circa 1900 when it was home to Constable Lawrence Fleming. Lovingly restored & improved, the home offers ample accommodation over two levels for a large family or for a dual, triple or even quadruple occupancy set-up. If you work from home or have a home-based business the floor-plan could work really well for you with multiple entry points.
Arguably the best location in the community-minded Emerald, the home sits on a corner block (NRZ1 zoning has development potential STCA) overlooking the puffing billy tracks and a very short stroll to shops, cafes, services, the primary school and lots of longer walks through Pepys Land, Emerald Lake, Wrights Forest and more. Take it all in from the picture-perfect cottage gardens or from the veranda that wraps around the east and north side of the upper level.
The gardens are beautifully maintained and stocked with all manner of cottage garden plants including a climbing wisteria bursting with plump lavender blooms in the spring months. There are plenty of outdoor spaces to enjoy including a BBQ area, front porch & rear patio sitting area as well as some lawn and a large open parking space.
Inside, original baltic pine floorboards & timber panelling line the large formal front lounge with floor to ceiling colonial windows. A country kitchen with 900mm range cooker, Asko dishwasher, plenty of bench space and storage lies beyond the meals area. A second living space, again with colonial windows and a sliding door that opens onto an outdoor entertaining area. A bedroom, spa bathroom & laundry complete the downstairs.
Up the beautiful timber balustraded stairwell and we find 5 more bedrooms and 3 more bathrooms each exquisitely decorated with fine fixtures and fittings. 4 of the 5 bedrooms open onto the veranda.
Currently run as a B&B - the chattels, website and goodwill can be negotiated as part of the sale.
To fully comprehend the floor plan and quality of this property make an appointment to view. Call Sue Colic on 0421 772 610.","SOLD - $990,000","6

cockatoo-vic-3781,237 Belgrave Gembrook Road Emerald VIC 3782,"'Hidden Valley'
Aptly named, Hidden Valley is everything it promises and more!
Located off a sealed road, almost 300m from the main road, and only 2 minutes drive from Wellington Rd and 5 minutes drive from the Emerald Township, this 2.3 acre property is nestled among the hills in its own private oasis with Menzies Creek running along the boundary.
The driveway curls around lovingly maintained gardens, peppered with mature Conifers and Japanese Maples, to the 3 bedroom, multi-level home which has been thoughtfully designed to capture the best views of the stunning landscape.
The wide tiled foyer leads into an inviting formal lounge room with new carpets and a beautiful wood heater for that cosy feel on those cold winter days when the mist is heavy on the hills beyond the window.
Opposite the formal lounge is the master bedroom, also with new carpets and a decent walk-in robe, adjacent ensuite and additional split system air conditioning for comfortable summer sleeping.
A wide, short staircase leads to the second level of the home, where the landing has outdoor access to a large, pergola, perfect for entertaining. The additional 2 spacious, robed bedrooms, both with new carpets, are also located on this level, in addition to a large laundry with plenty of storage, separate toilet, and a delightfully modern main bathroom with huge shower and bath.
The final short ascent leads to the main living zone. The informal lounge room with new carpets and high, inclined ceilings gives access to the impressive balcony which runs the length of the home and provides the most breathtaking views of the hills in the distance and the gardens below.
The large galley style kitchen features timber bench tops, breakfast bar and stainless steel appliances, and has an abundance of bench space with views over the gardens for a joyful cooking experience. Meals can be served in the adjoining dining area or through its own glass doors to the balcony and enjoyed with a chilled drink as the sun goes down.
The grounds themselves are 2.3 acres of fenced paddocks with large sheds for animal shelter, feed storage, machinery, and breeding tubs for hens, chicks and ducklings. There is an additional smaller area next to the home fenced off for the domesticated pets.
There is also a wood shed, a potting shed, glasshouse and an enclosed, raised veggie patch for the avid gardener, making this property the ultimate working hobby farm.
In addition to the double lock up garage for the cars, there is also another huge shed with concrete floors and power, perfect for tinkering the days away.
This home has been affectionately enriched and maintained over the years to become the delight it is today. A regretful sale but first to see will buy.

This magnificently presented 3 bedroom home is located on a quiet road in sought after Avonsleigh, and backs onto Wattle Creek in the idyllic Wrights Forest.
This stunning character home with dark vertical timbers welcomes you onto the wide, covered veranda where you can admire the views and sounds of nature before stepping into the serenity within. The generous lounge with wood heater and split system features exposed beam roof and large colonial windows which infuses the home with light and captures the essence of the environment.
The adjoining space comprises an open, workable kitchen with classy subway tiles and dark bench tops, and a large designated dining area that is complimented by gorgeous vinyl floorboards. This area has achieved the delicate balance of open space and cosy comfort though the large windows which overlook the front garden.
There are 3 good sized bedrooms with ceiling fans, the second with a large corner window which enhances the natural aspect that can be felt throughout the home. A good sized main bathroom is conveniently located to service the bedrooms and main living areas and features a classic claw foot bath, in keeping with the character features.
The master bedroom has a walk in robe with beautifully renovated ensuite and glass door access onto the veranda, which begins at the front and wraps around to the back of the home, culminating in a large covered entertaining area that makes you feel as if you are in a tree house where you can sit back and watch as Puffing Billy rolls by.
Stairs at the rear of the deck lead to the laundry and storage area under the house. The yard is fully fenced for animals and children and meanders to a flatter area at the embankment of the creek. There are areas for wood storage, a garden shed and a bungalow, or workshop with power. There is access to the rear of the yard for extra parking if the 4 off street car parks arent enough.
