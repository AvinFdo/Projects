drysdale-vic-3222,2 Eversley Street Drysdale VIC 3222,"What a Winner!
You can write your own profit cheque on the potential in this property. With so many outstanding options, the income you could generate here is a serious concern so get your bidding arm warmed up because bargains like this are as rare as hens teeth!
The most important points to note with 2 Eversley are:
Location
Size
Subdivision and
Rental/Resale
Situated right opposite the Drysdale Shopping Centre, aged care and community health centre and within walking distance of Neighbourhood centre, kindergarten, schools and medical/health facilities, you simply could not find a more convenient location.
The 809sqm corner block is absolutely PERFECT for subdivision (STCA) and would provide two substantial homes for rental or resale.
The existing clad dwelling is in amazing condition being first constructed in the art deco 1950s. It comprises 2 very generous bedrooms, a large lounge and separate dining leading onto the spacious central kitchen. An updated bathroom and partially renovated laundry room and rear entry/mudroom are ideal for first home buyers or retirees and the possibility to continue the modernisation whilst incorporating beautiful period features such as hardwood strip timber floors, deco cornicing and light fittings would make for a stunning contemporary home.
Presented in a neat, tidy, well maintained manner, it does not require much imagination or vision to be able to see this property for what it is...a goldmine!
