white-hills-vic-3550,34 Raglan Street White Hills VIC 3550,"Charming Modesty
The ever enduring lure of a white picket fence and iron-laced verandah remain to entice at this handy address. Stained glass windows and an open fireplace continue their charming presence, where 11' timber ceilings soar above Baltic pine floors. Gas heating and ducted cooling, plus a 900mm stainless steel cooker bring comfort and a little luxury indoors. The bathroom services 3 good-sized bedrooms and there's a multi-purpose room that could be a study or cosy second living area.
Simple yet sufficient to lend a rosy outlook, the sunny side garden has flexible prospects, whether screened to create a private retreat or utilised for extra off-street parking. Add a few pot plants and a splash of paving paint to the rear verandah, where a blank canvas inspires your preferred style of outdoor living.
A primary school sits just around the corner and it's only a 4 minute cycle to secondary college.
A nearby creek-side track also delivers a safe route into the CBD via Lake Weeroona in one direction, and Botanic Gardens park and pool in the other.
A short walk to shops and the bus stop into Bendigo adds even more convenience to this location.
Recent tenants who were paying $230 per week, have moved out allowing vacant possession.
Aluminium cladding, powder-coated front fence, new Colorbond fencing and on a compact allotment means minimal maintenance is required, ideal for busy people or investors.
Modest yet highly appealing, this property continues to possesses endearing allure.
