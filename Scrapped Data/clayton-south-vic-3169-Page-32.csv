clayton-south-vic-3169,6 Simon Street CLAYTON SOUTH VIC 3169,"Simon Says,This Is The Home You Want!
Talk about the home that has everything!Rising majestically from its slightly elevated allotment to project an air of grandeur that's replicated inside, this stately family residence of four bedrooms and two living zones is just the kind of upgrade your growing family has been craving.
From the very outset, you're introduced to the home's stately persona as a big and bright family living greets your arrival, delighting with its vast size and flowing sense of space.
The positive impressions of space and quality extend into the central kitchen, styled beautifully with modern cabinetry and quality stainless steel appliances, and if you love to entertain, you'll love the seamless integration between the separate dining and huge decked entertaining area (with spa).
Venture upstairs and discover an impressively large Master bedroom with built-in robes, beautifully finished ensuite and balcony, with additional bedrooms zoned in privacy downstairs along with a spacious family bathroom.
And then there's the space so much space! Garage and carport provides generous off-street parking, while those working from home could easily convert the workshop at the rear into a home office.
In an excellent location within walking distance of Namatjira Reserve and only moments away from Clayton train station, Clayton Central shopping district, Clayton South Primary School, St Andrew's Catholic Primary School, Monash Medical Centre and Monash University, this is an opportunity not to be missed.
