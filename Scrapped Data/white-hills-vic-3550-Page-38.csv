white-hills-vic-3550,239 Turners Road Junortoun VIC 3551,"BUSHLAND RETREAT ACREAGE NEAR ALL AMENITIES
Positioned midway between the many amenities of Strathfieldsaye and Junortoun, this country family home is just minutes from secondary and primary schools, shops, eateries, medical practitioners and more. With a bus stop just down the road, the home sits on over nine acres and provides the perfect blend of bushland tranquility with city proximity.
Set back from the road amongst established natives, the weatherboard house sits at the end of a long, circular driveway. A brick paved entry leads to the front door and indoors, quality timber flooring can be found throughout the hallway and main living space. The property offers four bedrooms. All enjoy built-in robes and one is generously proportioned with access to the outdoors, meaning it could easily also serve as a rumpus room or additional living space. The master bedroom provides a spacious walk-in robe and French doors open out to the rear yard and bushland. A huge, luxurious ensuite has been recently updated and enjoys a dual vanity, floor-to-ceiling tiling, a freestanding bathtub, walk-in shower with two showerheads and large dual aspect windows overlooking the private native garden beyond.
A spacious open plan kitchen, living and dining space is full of natural light and the new kitchen provides a timeless, modern country décor with white timber cabinetry and timber benchtops along with modern, quality appliances and ample storage.
