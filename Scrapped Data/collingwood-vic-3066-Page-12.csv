collingwood-vic-3066,54 Sydney Street Collingwood VIC 3066,"Warehouse conversion chic in cosmopolitan surrounds
Flaunting its industrial leather-goods-factory origins in extraordinary style, this unique three-bedroom, three-bathroom warehouse conversion indulges both space and luxury for a lavish modern lifestyle. Cocooned in the quiet comfort of solid-brick construction, the home provides tranquil sanctuary from its effervescent city-fringe surrounds where every desirable amenity is placed at its doorstep.
Tucked beyond a private and secure entry, the home expands into a sweeping open plan layout where daily relaxation, banquet dining and vibrant entertaining are effortlessly catered to in chic style. A melange of rustic brick, raw timbers and bold steel surfaces meld with on-trend finishes of glass, stacked stone and porcelain, highlighted by perfectly placed lighting. The hostess kitchen takes centre stage to the living, dining and family areas, fully appointed including a wide 900mm cooker, while adding to the room's panache with gleaming solid Red Gum benches.
Upstairs, private retreat is enjoyed within three lavishly sized bedrooms and a central spa-bathroom, including a master bedroom with a two-way ensuite and fitted dressing room, while a dedicated study or family retreat flows into an open-air terrace for alfresco enjoyment. Coddled in the cosiness of a slow-combustion wood heater, hydronic heating, split system air-conditioning and solar electricity, the home is completed by a large laundry, guest bathroom, remote double garage, and impeccable storage space for easy family living.
Set amid the dynamic atmosphere of Collingwood's abundant bars, restaurants, cafes and shopping, enjoy a convenient lifestyle with the Eastern freeway, public transport, local schools, and the verdant Yarra River parklands within arm's reach.
