Crafted to exacting standards with a remarkably versatile two-storey floorplan, this refined town residence has the rare ability to function seamlessly as an executive abode for the power couple or spacious home for those with multi-generational living requirements.
Its soaring clinker brick façade projects an image of sophistication that extends to the pristine interior, dressed with high quality appointments, rich timber floorboards, abundant natural light, wonderful high ceilings and textured feature walls that accentuate the home's cultured character.

The home's impressive size and scale extends to the oversized Master bedroom, which connects with two balconies and is serviced by a fully-tiled ensuite with a double shower. Two additional bedrooms also benefit from their private zoning upstairs and easy access to a central toilet and fully-tiled bathroom with a spa bath.
