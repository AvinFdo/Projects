clifton-hill-vic-3068,16 Dwyer Street CLIFTON HILL VIC 3068,"SITUATED ON 350SQM OF LAND...
Particularly generous proportions, elaborate period detail and a renovation designed to optimise light and space make this freestanding Edwardian (ca 1910) a residence of particular distinction. From the front verandah a leadlight door opens to a wide arched hallway, floored in Baltic pine, from which run three spacious bedrooms. Overlooking the front garden from a box bay window, the main bedroom includes a period-style ensuite bathroom and a dressing room. The second and third bedrooms have large windows to the side courtyard and verandah, and ceiling-height built-in wardrobes. Occupying the full width of the house, the sitting room is beautifully proportioned, with French doors opening to the verandah and folding timber panels separating it from the kitchen and dining area. The kitchen, well-equipped in contemporary style, includes premium appliances and custom-built cabinetry; it overlooks the sunny dining and informal living area which flows out to a timber deck and a paved northerly courtyard. To one side of the dining area is a large family bathroom/laundry. A generous garage with large mezzanine storage space opens from a readily accessible right of way.
A wealth of period detail includes several open fireplaces, fine plaster cornice work and panelling. Featuring evaporative cooling, ducted heating and an alarm system, this welcoming property is located in a quiet cul-de-sac street just metres from parkland, playing fields, Spensley Street Primary School and Walker street kindergarten. Clifton Hill Station, cafes and shops are within easy walking distance. See this and be delighted!

clifton-hill-vic-3068,9 Hilton Street CLIFTON HILL VIC 3068,"FREE-FLOWING LIVING SPACES
Here is a Clifton Hill cottage which is sure to please! The etched glass door from the lace-trimmed verandah opens into a surprisingly large living room with richly polished timber floors and an open fireplace with timber overmantel. A skilful renovation has linked the living room to the expansive dining area at the rear of the house – this flows out through a wall of glass to a larger than normal courtyard garden, with raised garden beds and a paved barbecue area. To one side is the kitchen, well-fitted with Smeg range, integrated dishwasher, and timber-finish cabinetry. Three bedrooms are set to the southern side of the house: all have quality built-in wardrobes, and the bedroom to the rear has a window wall to the garden. A central light court and a neat bathroom/laundry with over-bath shower complete this tranquil property, which features new gas heating, reverse-cycle airconditioning and an alarm system. Queens Parade, Brunswick Street, the Darling Gardens and primary schools are within strolling distance.","SOLD - $780,000","3

clifton-hill-vic-3068,3 Lang Street CLIFTON HILL VIC 3068,"YOUNG FAMILIES TAKE NOTE
This beautiful double-fronted Victorian home, with a quality renovation and extension by Nycek Design Architects, is tucked away in a cul-de-sac street. Conveniently located on the city side of Clifton Hill, within walking distance to the CBD and within the catchment zone for Gold Street primary, this home is sure to appeal to young families. Overlooking the lace-trimmed veranda are two spacious bedrooms, both with built-in wardrobes and traditional period detail. The wide central hallway opens to an attractive sitting room with gas-fired open fireplace and contemporary deep box shelving, opposite the good-sized third bedroom, which has access to extensive attic storage. Both of these rooms feature the original Baltic pine linings. Slightly elevated from the front of the house, the hall opens through glass panel double doors to a study (with custom shelving and desk), an elegant bathroom, fitted with full sized bath and walk in shower, and a full-size laundry with separate second WC. Set across the rear of the house is a well proportioned living and dining area with soaring ceilings and a deep bay window seat, and a streamlined contemporary kitchen equipped with stainless steel appliances and pantry. Light streams in from the courtyard garden through multiple sash windows, which look out to the pergola-covered barbecue deck. The garden is watered by a rain water tank, and there is rear access from a right of way. Walk through Darling Gardens to Queens Parade shops and public transport. 3 minute walk to Clifton Hill Primary School.
With its secluded setting and fine combination of period and modern comfort, this is a home and lifestyle with it all, to suit the most discerning buyer.

Here is what so many prospective buyers are seeking - a freestanding Edwardian residence located close to parkland, transport, schools and Village cafes.

The hallway opens into a well-proportioned living room with timber overmantel and Jetmaster gas fire. To the rear of the house are a neat bathroom, separate WC and concealed laundry. The dining area is open to a well-equipped timber kitchen - this sun-drenched open-plan space flows out to a large north-facing timber deck, fitted with storage boxes and bordered by plantings of Manchurian pears and dwarf lillipillies. Featuring open fireplaces, attractive plaster detail, ducted heating and reverse-cycle airconditioning, this welcoming property is just a few minutes walk from Dights Falls and Yarra parkland.

This handsome freestanding house has it all – spacious light-filled rooms, period detail, a large allotment (7.62m x 40.23m approx.) with two street frontages, and a prized Village location! A return verandah entry leads to a wide fretwork-trimmed hallway with windows to the bluestone lane at one side. Three ultra-large bedrooms, one with semi-ensuite bathroom, run from the hall, which opens into an expansive living room with access to a side courtyard. The original section of the house features japanned and Baltic pine overmantles, Baltic pine joinery, and intricate plasterwork. A well-planned extension to the rear houses a timber-finished kitchen and pantry, large dining and informal living area, second bathroom with separate WC, and a laundry. Two sets of French doors lead to the paved and treed north-facing courtyard, with car access from Lilly Street. Sound and comfortable now, this impressive property has potential for further renovation in this tranquil corner of Clifton Hill, close to transport, cafes and Yarra Parklands.

This freestanding Edwardian residence is bound to appeal. With a fretwork trimmed verandah and other period detail, it occupies an elevated north-facing block in quiet Dally Street, among other quality properties. Offered in sound well-presented condition with abundant natural light to all rooms, it has exciting potential for further renovation and a second storey extension (STCA) to take advantage of the view.

A laminate-finish kitchen, featuring the original stove overmantel, overlooks the dining area. Set to one side are a powder room/laundry and a smart spa bathroom.
