croydon-south-vic-3136,24 Longview Road Croydon South VIC 3136,"COUNTRY CHARM ON ¼ ACRE
With its tall manicured hedges, rambling gardens and abundant birdlife, you’d be forgiven for thinking you’d arrived at a private country estate. With just over ¼ acre of beautiful bush land to explore, and a back gate to Gracedale Park walking track, this charming cottage style home promises serene living close to schools, shops and East Ringwood station. The sand brick home sits at the top of the gently sloping property, with romantic leadlight windows, an open fireplace in the lounge, and a timber verandah perched amid the treetops. The secret garden promises endless adventure and enjoyment with shady native trees, a thriving vegetable patch, enough room for chickens and a 24,000L rainwater tank for self-sufficiency. Brick paved pathways, a solid timber door, Baltic Pine floors, textured carpet, ducted heating and a Fujitsu split system cooler create an inviting setting much like a charming bed and breakfast. Just steps away from Tinternvale Primary, Tintern Anglican Girls Grammar and the pictureseque pathways of The Tarralla Creek Trail, this is the kind of property that feels like a tree change only 30km from the CBD.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"3

Sliding doors access a covered pergola with a built-in bar. Incredibly inviting, a beautiful azure in-deck pool caters for alfresco recreation. The incredible size of the backyard is an outstanding feature in itself. Also occupying the vast space is a garden/storage shed and a cubby house. Tradesmen will appreciate the large side gate. Adding to the family-friendly appeal, the home is within walking distance to parkland, Tinternvale Primary School and close to a range of secondary schools, kindergartens, local shops and transport.

croydon-south-vic-3136,7 Ulysses Avenue Croydon South VIC 3136,"A Place Of Potential
Sited in a quiet, tree-lined street, this welcoming abode opens into an interior of warmth and comfort. The large entry foyer gives way to a spacious, smooth-flowing layout, further opened up by cathedral ceilings and floor-level windows that frame views of the leafy outdoors.
Generous living areas – which comprise a large lounge, formal dining, and relaxed kitchen and meals domain – are found to one side of the house, while 3 robed bedrooms (the master also with an ensuite) are serviced by the central bathroom and found on the other side.
External environs offer an abundance of space to enjoy the fresh air, showcasing a paved alfresco entertaining area overlooking a big, grassy backyard. An above-ground, outdoor spa is just another way to indulge in outside leisure, to the backdrop of undulating clouds and towering mountains.
As there are 2 electricity meters in the meter box, and the very rear of the property is connected for sewerage, water and electricity, a budding entrepreneur could see this as a great opportunity to set up private working quarters, or alternatively the potential for a dual occupancy site can be explored (all subject to council approval).
Located in easy reach of local schools, parks and shops, this lovely home is also just moments drive from the numerous conveniences of Eastland and EastLink.
Land size: approximately 874SQM
Features:
• Gas ducted heating
