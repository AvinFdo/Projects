doncaster-vic-3108,4/490 Doncaster Road Doncaster VIC 3108,"Easy Living in the Heart of Doncaster
Its privacy ensured by a position set well back from the road and an easy flow outdoors to the sheltered charms of its substantial backyard, this stylishly presented, 3 bedroom + study townhouse is a relaxing sanctuary in a vibrant Doncaster setting. Directly opposite the Eastern Golf Club, metres from Westfield Doncaster and moments from the Park & Ride, the home is ideally positioned for all your urban lifestyle aspirations.
With attractive Bamboo flooring underfoot, plenty of glorious natural light and appealing garden vistas in all directions, the home is particularly up-lifting as it highlights a broad open-plan living space that is arranged around a central staircase. The kitchen is suited to family life with volumes of cabinetry, whilst the flow outdoors to a generous backyard and paved outdoor dining suggests an al fresco lifestyle awaits.
The bedrooms are all set upstairs, privately, away from living. Parents will love the privacy of a master suite with its own study, an ensuite and walk-in robes, whilst the remaining bedrooms are adjacent to a central bathroom with separate wc and there is also a powder room downstairs.
Central gas ducted heating is a benefit of this home with split system cooling in each room and a large double garage.
Just wander over to Westfield for all your shopping needs, cafes, cinemas and plenty of buses, whilst you have plenty of parkland nearby, the Golf Club across the road and the Park & Ride just metres away for incredibly easy city commuting.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"3

doncaster-vic-3108,Doncaster VIC 3108,"Life Can Be A Dream!
The Tullamore lifestyle is a welcoming one with a relaxed sophistication and community-centric feel that is often sought but rarely found in Melbourne's inner suburbs.
Designed to deliver its residents space and tranquility, 5 Heritage Boulevard is not only an exquisite abode to live and luxuriate in, but a home centred amongst green parkland, shops, amenities and recreational activities all within arm's reach. Stroll through the leafy streetscapes, take a ride on a bike track or explore one of the many reserves and playgrounds of this wonderful estate. Enjoy the gentle hum of locals chatting at the Stables cafe or get fit and furious at the Next Gen Health and Wellness club which offers tennis courts, pools and fitness classes. Whatever is in your sights, the Tullamore estate is a new benchmark in urban living designed to complement the lifestyle you have been searching for.
After a day of activity, what better way to complete the journey than to retreat to a residence of luxury status. Situated on a spacious block of 475 sqm, 5 Heritage Boulevard is an outstanding opportunity to acquire a superbly appointed 4 bedroom, 6 bathroom home of exceptional design and aesthetic appeal. A spacious entry sets the tone and leads you towards the open plan living area where natural light spills through full height windows, bathing the strikingly private, yet expansive space. Here, the covered alfresco invites the outside in and beckons infinite opportunities for entertaining as does the chef-size kitchen, fully fitted with SMEG appliances, statement joinery and a generous butlers pantry.
A zoned, seamlessly flowing floorpan is what makes this house the idyllic family home and with a choice of 4 separate living areas plus a study, there is privacy for those of all ages. In addition, each upstairs bedroom boasts it's own ensuite and walk in robe, the master especially showcasing luxurious proportions and an antidote to the hectic pace of modern life. Imbued with relaxing hues throughout, here is the perfect space to rest and rejuvenate.
5 Heritage Boulevard is a true representation of contemporary design with a classic feel delivered with exquisite craftsmanship and quality. The result? Tullamore's finest offering with an enduring address in one of Melbourne's most rewarding locations.
