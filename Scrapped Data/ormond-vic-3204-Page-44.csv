Worthy of a master chef, the centrepiece culinary kitchen is unlike anything you have seen before with a Pitt cooktop where the burners seemingly float above the Porcelain benchtops, an induction cooktop, two ovens, two sinks, two European dishwashers, an extra-large integrated fridge and freezer and a waterfall-edge central island/breakfast bar to display your gourmet feasts.
The upper level offers a superb arrangement of a second living zone, a sumptuous main ensuite bedroom, two more bedrooms and a family bathroom.
Along with the advantage of a double garage behind no-maintenance aluminium wood-like battens, this remarkable approximately 35-square residence also features a glamorous powder room with teardrop basin, large laundry, zoned ducted heating and refrigerated air conditioning, thermally broken double-glazed aluminium windows, Engineered Oak flooring, plush carpets, central vacuuming, Quantum Quartz bathroom benchtops, freestanding elliptical soak tubs in each upstairs bathroom, walk-in robes in all four bedrooms, fireplace in living room, side courtyard to enjoy a morning coffee, cavernous under-stair storage, hallway cupboards and bespoke joinery throughout.
