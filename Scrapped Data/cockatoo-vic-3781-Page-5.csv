A front deck with led lighting welcomes you into the property with high ceilings and sophisticated colour tones. Inside the spacious open plan living has all the comforts you would expect including plantation shutters and double blinds.
Featuring three great sized bedrooms, master boasting full ensuite and walk in robe, robed secondary bedrooms and a beautifully appointed gloss white kitchen with stainless steel appliances overlooking the living and dining zones, sliding doors open to reveal a decked outdoor sitting area with rustic bar that takes full advantage of the generous rear gardens with garden shed (plenty of space for play, extra vehicles, future shedding etc.)
