Cutting an imposing figure from its elevated street position, this brilliantly located property is the perfect opportunity for family living in a picturesque community.
Set back on a huge 1,147sq m (approx) block, the spacious brick residence is a clever combination of style and practicality.
Entering via multi-levelled steps, you're greeted by the tiled entry-way and large open living room which enjoys a warm, bright feel and fantastic views via large east facing windows.

The spacious kitchen has a classic feel, featuring glass electric cook top, wall mounted stainless steel oven, an appliance cupboard, plenty of cupboard space and beautiful long benches. A dishwasher and double pantry complete a brilliant hub.
A central second living zone and spacious rumpus or play area opens up to the magnificent merbau deck making indoor/outdoor living a breeze.
Two large bedrooms have built-in robes, the second with large light filled windows and access to the outdoor deck via a sliding door.

With a built-in spa bath, marble top vanity, corner shower and separate toilet the main bathroom is not just equipped to handle the demand of a growing family but is a place to relax and enjoy.
