ormond-vic-3204,15 Ulupna Road Ormond VIC 3204,"A brilliant redevelopment opportunity (STCA)
Here's an exciting redevelopment opportunity in the heart of Ormond - just around the corner from North Road shops, eateries, trains and buses and with reserves, recreation and schools nearby! In need of total renovation, the aged house on this prime allotment of approx 696sqm is divided into 2 dwellings. At the front is a 2-bedroom unit that includes an open living room with kitchen, and a laundry and bathroom. At the rear is a second, much larger unit with kitchen open to the living room, 2-3 bedrooms (1 of which is huge and could be another living area), and a bathroom and laundry. The large, well established garden has paving for alfresco entertaining. While the house is probably past its use-by date, this property has a bright future indeed!

Arguably one of the last, certainly one of the best, absolutely one of the highest, this might be the one of the last great Zone renovation opportunities on the Hill! Set on a highpoint of Ormond Hill at this prized McKinnon Secondary College Zone address, Cathel c.1928 has been maintained in time-capsule condition by the same family over the last 60 years.
Detailed to a superior standard with a distinctive leadlight and pressed glass windows and lofty decorative ceilings, this solid-brick home is offered in excellent original condition with never-painted timber panelling and cabinetry, an impressive arched brick fireplace and hardwood floors with a trace of original black-japan throughout.
Graced with fine formal lounge and dining rooms and two high-ceilinged bedrooms, the home is updated with fresh white bathroom and features an functional eat-in kitchen. Perfectly sited on the block with generous approx. 6500sqft/604sqm gardens awaiting a family-wise extension, the temptation to step up to a second storey will be impossible to resist with vast views across the treetops towards the bay guaranteed and a city skyline glimpse a definite possibility.
Check out the location (just 800m to Ormond shops and station, a stroll to Ormond Primary School and one block to the North Rd), look at the period beauty, see the potential for views and bring your vision to this highpoint home! Land 38.11m/125ft x 15.85m/52ft approx.","SOLD - $1,420,000","2

ormond-vic-3204,4/27 Katandra Road Ormond VIC 3204,"Renovated & packed with deluxe extras
Bursting with vitality, with a fresh, light brightness, this extra spacious villa was given the deluxe treatment. Packed with extras - such as ducted heating and cooling, ducted vacuum system, solar panels, instant hot water - it was renovated to a high specification with quality finishes and fittings, and it is stylishly presented to accentuate its bountiful attractions. A flowing floorplan, larger-than-expected rooms, and a low maintenance look make the lifestyle here relaxing and appealing. Off the wide tiled entrance hall, a large sunny lounge room has a gas log fire. The kitchen (open to the dining area) is a beauty with its stone benchtops, stainless steel appliances, glass splashback, gas cooktop, double wall ovens, integrated microwave, and walk-in pantry. The 2 bedrooms have built-in wardrobes, and there are twin lockup garages. In addition, there is a plus-size paved courtyard wrapped around two sides of the home. At the rear of a well kept development of only 4 homes, this property is a couple of minutes' walk to Ormond village shops, cafes, train station and buses, and to Kilvington, reserves and recreation.
