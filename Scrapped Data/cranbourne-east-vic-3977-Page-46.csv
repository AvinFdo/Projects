MAYFIELD ESTATE, CRANBOURNE EAST (124779270): **THIS PROPERTY IS LOCATED DIRECTLY OFF LINEHAM DRIVE** The problem with building is the time involved after you wait for the land to be released, then let the builder do their job, get the keys and move in, you could be looking at well over a year wasted. But, with this home in the flourishing Mayfield estate, not only has all this been done for you, but its also been fully landscaped and requires nothing more from you other than to move your furniture in, or to get a board up and lease out so why would you build?
Beautifully constructed by Porter Davis to a 7-star energy rating and finished by the owners with a keen eye for detail, this home has been occupied for less than six months and presents with display quality and style. Providing a low maintenance nature to suit a busy lifestyle, it features a gorgeous front facade and complementing gardens. Inside the timber look floors greet you upon entry and lead you to the open living/dining area where you will also find the galley style kitchen with stone benches, stainless appliances, soft close cabinetry and a semi-walk in pantry.
Theres also another living area upstairs plus 3 robed bedrooms, including the master with a walk in wardrobe and an impressive ensuite to match the family bathroom and additional downstairs powder room. A host of extras add to the comfort and appeal including double glazed windows throughout, ducted heating, evaporative cooling and LED downlights.
Outside theres a double remote garage with internal access and a landscaped courtyard with manicured lawns, a garden shed and an alfresco area with roof mounted speakers!
Within a short drive to freeway access and all amenities located in the townships of Berwick, Clyde and Cranbourne this sensational opportunity is only minutes away from the popular Clyde Primary School, Casey RACE Recreation & Aquatic Centre and Casey Indoor Sports Centre!
