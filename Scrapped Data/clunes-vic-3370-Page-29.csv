Combining a tranquil bush setting with the convenience of easy access to the Midland Highway, this three-hectare bush block is ready for your Escape to the country' dream home.
Serviced by formed gravel roads to the North & South, this triangular block overlooks the fertile basalt farmlands sweeping from Springmount to the Northeast & to Clarkes Hill & Dean in the Southeast. High speed internet broadband is available.
This former farmland, now covered with a rapidly regenerating Central Highlands forest offers wildflowers, wildlife habitat, a sustainable firewood supply and even sufficient timber for a house & outbuildings.
There is a small dam and an enormous drawcard for fossickers with the 1100 hectare Regional Park adjoining. This park also adds potential for B&B accommodation (STCA), especially as the Ballarat to Bendigo Goldfields walking, cycling & horse riding trails passes by.
A huge advantage to this private sanctuary is the approved planning permit for a four bedroom home with construction to start before April 2021 (plans available); making the hurdle for building one step closer.
With perfect base for a home's foundation & driveway along with more fertile soil for a vineyard or garden, this property promises to offer premium lifestyle opportunities, just 6kms from the beautiful Creswick township.","SOLD - $295,000",2.91ha,Vacant land,Sold by private treaty 4 Jun 2019,"86 Davey Road, Springmount VIC 3364 was last sold in 2019.",0,https://www.domain.com.au/86-davey-road-springmount-vic-3364-2015277511,"Neighbourhood Insights
