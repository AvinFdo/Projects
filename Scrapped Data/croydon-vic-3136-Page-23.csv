Oozing charm and heart-warming appeal, there's so much to love about this solid clinker brick home,
positioned within close proximity to shops, schools and public transport and affording a comfortable life
within a popular pocket of Croydon.
Occupying a generous 863m2 (approx.) block, this single level, four bedroom residence is located within

living zones, beginning with the comfortable lounge boasting a feature brick wall, balanced by a neutral
colour scheme repeated throughout the interior.

character, and spills outdoors to a deck built for entertaining. Also cleverly placed in the casual living
zone is the well designed timber kitchen featuring an electric double oven and gas stove, stainless steel
dishwasher, step-in pantry, breakfast bar and slate flooring for a practical finish.
Accommodating the needs of a growing family, three of the four bedrooms are fitted with built-in robes,
including the master, which also boasts a fully renovated ensuite-effect bathroom comprising a large
vanity, contrasting floor-to-wall tiles and a walk-in shower.
With the benefit of a large backyard for children and pets, the home also brings together some
appreciable inclusions with; separate laundry, gas ducted heating, evaporative cooling, built-in cupboards (family room), double linen cupboard, established garden, fruit trees, water tank (plumbed to
toilet), remote double garage and off-street parking.
