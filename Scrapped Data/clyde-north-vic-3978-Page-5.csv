St Germain Estate is only a short drive to Berwick Village, freeway access, medical centres, supermarkets, train station and public transport. Combine this long list of shopping precincts, educational amenities and with the Berwick train station only a short drive away, it's no surprise why Clyde North has become one of Melbourne's fastest growing suburbs.
St Germain is located on Thompsons Road, approximately 10 minutes from the Princes Freeway (M1) and Berwick. Part of the booming south eastern corridor, it is only 45 minutes from Melbourne's CBD and 30 minutes from the beautiful coastal towns of the Mornington Peninsula.
It's time to start living your dream!
