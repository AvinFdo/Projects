Built-in 2003 with form and functionality as the design brief, this home has been constructed to an exacting standard.
Set on an amazing 756m2, this home provides for all. Through the front doorway the quality is obvious. With high ceilings and central hallway, this home leads to a design easy to follow and without complication.
Zoned living at its best means the front has a study, the 4 generous bedrooms (Master with WIR and ENS) all with BIR, with access to central bathroom, laundry and internal access to an amazing internal garage for 3 cars. The garage is comprised of a main double door and a single door for the extra car, boat or trailer. Rear access is easy with another single roller door to the rear yard.
Back into the home and the central hallway leads to the rear living area for all the family. Timber colonial style kitchen with massive room to move and quality appliances makes this area a dream with wrap around benchtop for everyday living. The adjoining dining area sees families enjoying mealtime with ease and comfort.
The rear area then moves to the side where an undercover entertainers area is an absolute gem. Complete with its own woodheater and electric retracting shades means this is the perfect outdoor/indoor area for all year round.
The rear yard also boasts an additional double garage that can be used as storage/workshop or other application as the need arises. The rear yard is spacious and uncluttered.
The home has magnificent connected solar power that wont see a power bill again and has ducted heating throughout. Several split systems throughout the home give the ability to zone the climate as required.
With other massive features including security system, massive side drive to the rear garage and gorgeous ornate period features make this home an absolute winner for anyone looking to buy. 10 Roseview Way St Albans Park a MUST SEE!","SOLD - $622,000","4
