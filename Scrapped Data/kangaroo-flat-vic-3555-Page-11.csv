kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,27 Hill Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Shortcut to Tipperary
With privacy assured by its secluded entrance, prepare for an unquestionably pleasant surprise! In this price range, you come to expect a cosy home that at least needs a thorough cosmetic makeover. But at this address, it's all been done, and in such fine harmony with the many original features of this utterly charming cottage.
Beneath high timber ceilings, 2 in rare Dutch-style, grey-painted dadoes embrace rooms refreshed by a palette of soft green and white. Floating floorboards flow throughout the interior, as does reverse cycle air conditioning, while a wood heater adds warmth and ambience in the dining room.
Sympathetically designed to suit the era in which it was built, the spacious kitchen caters for modern demands with dishwasher and 900mm stove. Topped by timber benches, elegant cabinetry incorporates glass cabinetry, wine racks and pot drawers. However, sitting centre stage is the star of the show, the slow combustion stove aptly highlighted in red, retained for its wealth of character. Bathroom and laundry own timber benches too, along with many more gorgeous gleaming extras. Both bedrooms have a whole wall of built-in robes.
A broad elevated verandah, once the front of the house, is now a beautiful outdoor living area overlooking lofty eucalypts of Tipperary Gully. It looks like a terrific spot for easy bushwalking and a recreation reserve nearby offers a place for picnics plus a playground. Backing onto Railway Street, take the shortcut to Bunnings, Homemaker Centre, Lansell Square or Jumpz Trampoline Park. Handy for commuters, it's close to train station and highway too. The property even has a huge shed with concrete floor, power and 2 large rooms for storage, office or workshop.
Value, quality and convenience must put this home at the top of any savvy buyers list!","SOLD - $267,000","2

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,19 Muir Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Ready and Waiting..!
First home buyers, astute investors and farmers retiring into town will want to be quick off the mark to see this property! Just off the beaten track, yet surprisingly close to conveniences, its quiet location will no doubt be a winner too.
A multi-purpose sunroom, gym or rumpus room adds bonus living space to a lounge that has a place for a study zone. Beside an open dining area, the beautifully refurbished kitchen has a super stylish hexagon tiled splashback and contemporary breakfast bar infusing designer flavour. Dishwasher and gas cooktop are always welcome inclusions. Bathroom and laundry have also been modernised, appointed with new cabinetry, tiling and fittings for a new era.
All 3 bedrooms have built-in robes as well as ceiling fans, 2 look terrific with gorgeous feature walls and the main is a great size. Split system heating & cooling and a gas wall heater ensure local temps are kept under control year round.
Alongside lawn edged by a curvaceous landscaped border stands a 6.2 x 6.2 metre shed to accommodate cars and a sunny barbeque area. Well planted garden beds grace the front yard too, framing a further expanse of grass.
It's a 20 minute walk to the shopping precinct and primary school or ride there by bike in 6. Stroll to the train station and botanical gardens in 15 minutes, playground at the end of the street or dog park around the corner. Lansell Square and Bunnings are only 25 minutes away for good incentive to go for longer walk.
