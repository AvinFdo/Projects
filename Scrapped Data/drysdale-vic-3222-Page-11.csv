drysdale-vic-3222,9 Newfields Drive Drysdale VIC 3222,"Pretty As A Picture
Showcasing a stunning light and bright 'feel' this quality build will feel like home from the moment you turn the key.
• An impressive street scape sets an anticipation for what will be a memorable inspection; I couldn't think of another property in today's market that nails the brief 'nothing to be done'!
• The main living area boasts a lovely northerly orientation and ensures it is bathed in natural light all year round. Expansive glass stacker doors beautifully frame fully landscaped rear gardens and create a seamless inside/outside connection to a beautifully appointed decked alfresco zone – perfect place for an early coffee and/or a glass of your favourite wine at sunset.
• The kitchen 'serves up' a practical user friendly design (complete with expansive walk in pantry) and boasts some luxury features including dual Caesar 200mm stone bench tops, feature pendant lighting and 900ml stainless steel gas cooker.
• A second living area continues the theme of 'light and bright' and provides further conveniences to what is a lovely free flowing floor plan.
• The master bedroom suit is spacious and is complete with an equally generous walk in robe. A trio of floor to ceiling feature windows provide lovely natural light and enhance the neutral tones. The additional bedrooms are generously sized and have built in robes.
• Simply too many additional features to list but here is just a few to wet your appetite; ducted heating, split system cooling, designer ceiling fans, porcelain tiles, double remote controlled garage and quality finishes throughout.
• Central Walk has quickly established itself as Drysdale's exclusive estate. Beautiful wetlands, open tree lined streets and homes stamped with quality as far as the eye can see. This property looks a wonderful home for today and savvy investment for the future.","SOLD - $539,000","3
