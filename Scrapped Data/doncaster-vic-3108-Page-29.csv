Generously proportioned with sizeable living areas on a smart fully landscaped block that's very easy to maintain, it's therefore perfect for those desiring the space of a house with low-maintenance benefits.
Brilliant indoor-outdoor living is a design feature celebrated by the huge open-plan living, which makes a bold impression with its vast sense of space and integration with the entertainer's deck set against landscaped gardens.
The presence of a Butler's pantry with a four-burner cooktop means you can keep the first-class kitchen (with feature island bench, stone benchtops, 900mm Blanco stainless steel cooker, loads of storage and walk-in pantry) in pristine condition, while a downstairs robed guest bedroom with a sleek ensuite is perfect for accommodating the in-laws.
That essence of size and space extends to the upstairs floorplan, where a large central retreat is accompanied by three robed bedrooms, a bright family bathroom and huge master bedroom, complete with a large walk-in dressing room and lavish ensuite with a deluxe double shower.
Finished with a large laundry with excellent storage options, downstairs powder room, separate study, ducted heating, evaporative cooling and a remote double garage, this luxurious experience is enhanced by living within 12km (approx.) east of Melbourne's CBD and even closer to the Eastern Freeway, the Park + Ride, excellent schools and Westfield Shoppingtown.","SOLD - $1,570,000","5

doncaster-vic-3108,5 Harvell Court Doncaster VIC 3108,"Light-filled family home in a premier cul-de-sac.
Sale By Set Date Tuesday 23 October at 6.00pm
Backing onto peaceful Ruffey Creek walking tracks in a prized cul de sac that attracts minimal traffic flow and is therefore the perfect environment for raising a young family, embrace the quintessential family lifestyle that's on offer with this sensational five-bedroom family home on a tranquil 700sqm (approx.) block.
Impressive amounts of glass ensure the interior of this pristine split-level interior is showered in natural light, while its perfect orientation means an abundance of northern sunlight is also filtered into the home.
Towering cathedral ceilings accentuate the height and space of the elegant sunken formal lounge and dining arrangement set against a beautiful leafy backdrop, and fend off the chills of winter by curling up in front of the Coonara heater that delivers abundant heat throughout the split-level open-plan living zone.
Catering for a growing household is easy when you have a large well-appointed kitchen at your service, and come summer, you'll be inspired to cook outdoors in the peaceful sanctuary that is the north-facing backyard comprising an excellent undercover deck, easy-care gardens and a garden water feature.
All five bedrooms enjoy the benefits of space and comfort (master bedroom with a large walk-in robe, ensuite and north-facing leafy views), while a bright family bathroom, split-system cooling, ducted heating, ducted refrigerated cooling and ducted vacuum provide a luxurious touch.
Open the rear gate and enjoy brisk morning walks or weekend bike rides with the kids along the Ruffey Creek Trail and through nearby Ruffey Lake Park, while living inside the Templestowe Heights Primary School and Templestowe College catchment area is perfect for those placing an importance on their children's education.
Offering swift access to Aquarena Leisure Centre, Westfield Shoppingtown, bus services and the Eastern Freeway, don't let a good thing go!","SOLD - $1,246,500","5
