croydon-vic-3136,17 Robert Court Croydon VIC 3136,"The Parents Retreat!!!
The contemporary concepts of ""must have"" alfresco spaces and multi-zoned interiors are excelled by this design-friendly family domain ... where indoor-outdoor boundaries are blurred to deliver a spacious and fluid living environment.
The overwhelming 'fresco feel' begins with an all-encompassing back courtyard that sweeps elegantly and extensively around the home's character ... providing stunning vantage points to enjoy its established courtyard that's privately screened by a curtain of flourishing flora. And the flexible 'fresco options culminate at the rear with a spectacular ""outdoor living room"".
This remarkable lifestyle-focus also displays inside, where the floorplan shows complete respect for parents' and children's privacy. The master bedroom and ensuite reside in their own wing, well away from the other 3 bedrooms. The TWO separate living rooms are perfectly placed so that the rumpus might just be claimed as YOUR very own parents' retreat/lounge! Or perhaps it will be the games-room and sports-bar you've always wanted!
Pristine presentation simply serves to highlight ALL this home has to offer you - including top of the range Bosch hydronic heating right throughout, split system air-conditioning upstairs and window unit downstairs, striking pressed tin backsplash, top of the range 900mm upright oven and rangehood, topping it off with stunning stone benchtops.
A securely fenced and gated boundary allows this polished family home to make use of EVERY glorious inch of this large manicured 525sqm block - a prominent practical location just moments from Oxley Christian School, Manchester Primary, Mooroolbark College - and yet, it's a leafy private haven for premium living and entertaining!
Opportunities such as this is are often heard of but rarely found, an inspection we assure you will not disappoint.","SOLD - $730,000","4

Arrive at this elite, country-style neighbourhood and fall in love with this exquisite, updated 3 bedroom 2 bathroom character weatherboard home. Set on a private 839 m² (approx.) corner block, you'll feel a world away, yet you're close to Croydon station, Main St shops, Chirnside Shopping Centre, Luther College, Yarra Valley Grammar, Ruskin Park Primary and Swinburne University. Near EastLink and reserves. A picket fence, undercover deck with mountain views, pretty established gardens and secure double carport with storage/workshop room exude picture-perfect street appeal. The rejuvenated, enclosed gardens are splendid for relaxing, entertaining or children; they have red brick courtyards, many plants, shade trees and spacious lawn. This elegant, light-filled home is freshly painted and seamlessly fuses ornate charm with modern comfort. Walk through the sizeable entry hallway and be wowed by 2 large living zones, classic high panelled ceilings, plate rails, decorative cornices, French doors, 2 character-style bathrooms with tessellated floor tiles, and leadlight sash windows. Serene garden outlooks, period-style fittings, hardwood polished floors and ducted heating/cooling add to the sophisticated ambience. Three double bedrooms (BIRs, bedroom 2 with bay window seat, bedroom 1 with French garden doors) and a main bathroom resplendent with claw foot bath are privately zoned; the quiet master suite has triple BIRs and ensuite. Share conversations by the open fireplace in the beautiful formal lounge, or host dinners in the formal dining area, which could potentially be a study or 4th bedroom conversion.

croydon-vic-3136,6 Monteith Street Croydon VIC 3136,"A DEVELOPERS DREAM IN THE ‘TOORAK’ POCKET OF CROYDON
They don’t come much better than this for buyers looking for future redevelopment prospects.
Set on a substantial 1157m2 block in the highly sought after and adored Monastery area, this immaculate and original three-bedroom abode has stood the test of time and is now screaming for some enthusiastic buyers to give her new sparkle, build your new dream home or for property redevelopers to consider the almost completely flat site to make way for up to three new townhouses (STCA).
Along with being extremely comfortable with the potential to live in or rent out, the floorplan also provides a main living room with gas heating, a spotless bathroom and a separate kitchen and meals area. Outside, the double carport and sufficient off street parking is appealing, and the addition of a garden shed and a bungalow/studio which is privately placed at the very rear of the block adds more appeal.
The well-established, and what is considered the affluent pocket of the area, this lovely property also prides on being close to the Croydon train station and Main street shops, with McAdam Square shops across Maroondah Hwy and quality schools, including Luther College, Yarra Valley Grammar and Good Shepherd Primary School.","SOLD - $999,950","3
