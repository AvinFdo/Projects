clunes-vic-3370,50 Mcleods Road Mount Glasgow VIC 3371,"Amazing Rural Block with a Million Dollar View.
Situated in the picturesque township of Mount Glasgow and just 10 minutes from Clunes and 35 Minutes to Ballarat & Daylesford is this 17.8 acre property with commanding panoramic views. The hard work has been done with the level home site cleared and Power connected to the box. The original home was demolished with planning permits lodged for a new home which have unfortunately lapsed. Currently used as a weekend getaway for its Melbourne owners, with a heavy heart they are passing on this opportunity to build a stunning home in this unique environment to another lucky person.
The current home site sits near the middle of the block with a gated driveway already in place, watertanks, shedding and a caravan with a dam nearby and a rambling pathway leading you up the side of Mount Glasgow. Surrounded by farmland and State Reserve, the views are truly something to behold.
Here is your chance to purchase a significant land holding for the price of a small residential block.
Please Contact our agent to organise your own private inspection.

The designs are reversed yet offer completely different facades, while the sleek open plan incorporates three cosy carpeted bedrooms with built in robes, a stylish ensuite & family bathrooms, a lovely light meals/family room connected seamlessly with tasteful timber look floors to a modern kitchen with subway splash backs and stainless steel appliances.
A slightly raised deck and a fully contained yard for private gardening just caps off these sensational homes, while the location is paramount with 20 minutes drive to Ballarat, 20 minutes to Daylesford and easy access to Melbourne for daily commuters.
