kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,9 Tununga Circuit Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"STUNNING CONTEMPORARY STYLE AND SOPHISTICATION
Located at the very top of Byambee Rises Estate, and directly across the road from a playground and park, is this immaculate double storey property. With easy access to Lansell Square and bus stops, and just minutes from the Kangaroo Flat train station, this stunning home is beautifully presented both inside and out.
With fantastic curb appeal, a beautifully landscaped garden welcomes you to the home. A large entry leads to secure access into the double garage on one side, and on the other is a fantastic guest suite. This generously proportioned room includes built-in robes and a two-way bathroom that serves as an ensuite. A separate toilet, linen closet and understair closet are just a few of the clever design features found in the home. A second bedroom with built-in robe is neatly tucked away, as is the spacious laundry – complete with walk-in storage and access to the side yard. At the rear of the ground floor is a large living space that currently serves as a secondary living and dining room, but would also make an excellent rumpus room and study nook.
Up the carpeted stairs is a large landing leading to a powder room, fourth bedroom and the generous master bedroom. The master enjoys a large walk-in robe running along the full side of the room, and to the other side is an ensuite with double vanity, walk-in shower and separate toilet. An open plan kitchen, living and dining room completes the internal design and this high-end area includes stunning light fittings, Caesar stone benchtops, black sink and tapware, walk-in pantry and a lovely balcony with sensational views over the city and forest.
The beautifully manicured outdoor space features a paved alfresco area, sunny courtyard and established mop top trees with neat hedging. A lawn area adds to the many places to sit and relax, and the double garage provides vehicle access and single door access to the back garden.
Additional features include:
Ducted refrigerative cooling and ducted heating throughout
Ducted vacuum system
Modern appliances including five-burner gas cooktop, 900mm oven and dishwasher
Tinted windows with blockout thermal blinds
Automatic sprinkler system
Garden shed
Access from both sides of the house to the rear garden
Close to all amenities and conveniently located on the Melbourne side of the city, this elevated two-storey property is absolutely ideal for a professional seeking a home with a quality design and finish. Alternatively, with a small and beautifully maintained garden and spacious floor plan, this is the ideal property for an older family or a buyer looking to downsize without compromising on lifestyle.","SOLD - $635,000","4

There are fully fitted built-in robes to the three bedrooms, the bathroom is superb with extensive tiling, 1200mm frameless shower, vanity with storage and a separate toilet room. The laundry boasts good storage and timber bench and is handy to the kitchen and bedrooms.
The home also boasts ducted gas heating and evaporative cooling throughout, new LED downlights in living spaces, new spouts and plumbing work. Located on a good sized 603m2 yard with good fencing and a recently landscaped front.
