collingwood-vic-3066,10 Budd Street COLLINGWOOD VIC 3066,"RARE, UN-RENOVATED INNER CITY VICTORIAN
A classical cottage in the very heart of Collingwood, this captivating Victorian is an entry level opportunity that makes perfect sense from either lifestyle or investment perspectives.
An intimate original floor-plan features a bright double bedroom and a separate study arranged around a central living/dining space beneath traditional high ceilings.
A serviceable older style kitchen and spacious, similarly functional bathroom complete current day spaces while a courtyard conclusion completes a tempting opportunity!
Openings such as this, where potential and position form such a compelling combination, are increasingly un-common - and will only become more so with the passage of time.
Proximity to the CBD, Smith Street shops and trams and the cafe culture that defines Brunswick Street makes this evocative cottage an even more tempting proposition!
