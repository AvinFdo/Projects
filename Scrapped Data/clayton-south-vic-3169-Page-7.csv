clayton-south-vic-3169,16 Merlyn Avenue Clayton South VIC 3169,"Rich In Potential!
SMS ""16Merlyn"" to 0488 883 810 for digital brochures
Defined by its incredible potential on a sizeable 582sqm (approx.) north-facing allotment in a fantastic location, an amazing opportunity presents itself for the astute buyer to brush a stroke or two on this blank canvas and create something truly magical.
Package the generous land dimensions with a desirable setting where Namatjira Park resides at the end of the quiet street and it's easy to see the merit in this solid investment. Dual occupancy development opportunities (STCA) will certainly appeal to many, however it's also a fantastic opportunity to build your dream home in a family-favourite location (STCA) that's an easy walk to the Clayton Road shopping strip, Clayton train station and Clayton South Primary School and just minutes away from Monash Medical Centre, Monash University and the Monash Freeway.
The original three-bedroom, single-level home is perfectly livable as is, and whilst there's scope for modernising, you're free to move straight in and enjoy the warm timber floorboards, cosy lounge with gas heating, well-appointed kitchen, huge grassed backyard, single lock-up garage, plenty of space for extra off-street parking and ducted heating.
So many options, but just one opportunity.

clayton-south-vic-3169,13 Glenmorgan Close Clayton South VIC 3169,"A Flawless Family Entertainer
Serenely positioned in a tree-lined cul-de-sac lies this single-level family home, which showcases an exemplary level of style in a supreme setting close to Springvale Shopping Centre.
Wander past an immaculately landscaped front garden and step inside where luxurious timber floors spread stylishly across a generously proportioned living area and into the central dining room, where you'll love hosting dinner parties. And given the amount of entertaining you'll be doing, it's a good thing there's a contemporary gourmet kitchen by your side, complete with quality stainless steel appliances and a copious amount of storage space.
Flowing outdoors, a spectacular undercover entertainer's deck that looks across the low-maintenance backyard is fitted with café blinds to protect you from Melbourne's unpredictable weather and delivers a genuine year-round entertaining space for BBQs with friends.
Back inside, a central renovated bathroom instantly appeals with its deep bath to calm the mind, while four excellent bedrooms (spacious master bedroom with ensuite) offer plenty of space and comfort.
Featuring a secure garage, study, split-system heating/cooling, separate laundry and two sheds, this flawless family upsizer also enjoys convenient access to The Grange Reserve, Westall and Springvale train stations, Westall primary and secondary schools, Clayton South Primary School and Monash University Clayton Campus.
