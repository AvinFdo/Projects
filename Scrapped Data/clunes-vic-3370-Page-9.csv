clunes-vic-3370,28 Fraser Street Clunes VIC 3370,"Old State Bank part of Clunes History
A building with iconic early goldfields architecture, this building was built in the 1870s and displays many of the original period features.
Featured in the 2003 movie starring Heath Ledger, the building has a shop space with original bank counter and vault along with a grand living area upstairs with 5 bedrooms.
There is also a large cellar attached to the kitchen downstairs, signifying an era of grandeur fit for the prestigious position afforded a bank manager.
In fact, older members of the community remember invitations to the grand balls held upstairs in the formal living area being the most sought after in town.
Clunes itself is well known for its book town weekend whereby thousands of visitors converge on the tiny town as well as having been the backdrop for Mad Max and Halifax FP.
The building is ready to be shop and bed and breakfast with separate entrances to the commercial and residential wings.
All the hard work has been done in getting this building up to date.
New spouting downpipes and repaired valley, massive earthworks to re-expose the floor vents, heating and cooling installation, roof insulation, sewer connections including connection points for new bathroom in bultlers pantry, landscaped garden just needing final touch, new circuit boards for commercial and residential occupancy,
all that is left is the fun stuff.
For those who seek affordable grandeur and wanting a tree change whilst making an income from having a business, this building affords multiple business opportunities and residential splendor in beautiful country.
