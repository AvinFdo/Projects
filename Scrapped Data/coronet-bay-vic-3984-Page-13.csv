coronet-bay-vic-3984,15 Shepherd Road Grantville VIC 3984,"Peaceful Cottage Gardens
WE ARE ACTIVE FOR APPRAISALS AND INSPECTIONS.
Located on the high side in a quiet cul de sac with filtered views to Western Port Bay and French Island, this cute 3 bedroom dwelling with cottage gardens is waiting for the right person to give it the love it deserves.
The cosy kitchen has electric cooking, original floorboards in the open plan living area with high ceilings and small exposed beams, adding some character to the home. There is carpet in the bedrooms and large windows to let in the light, all the necessities are there for living in while you refurbish and bring this house back to its former glory. The mantle-piece in the lounge is an appealing feature. Restoration maybe needed to bring the fire place back to workable condition. There is also a split system heating/cooling unit in the lounge to keep the temperature at desired levels.
Outside the house is well maintained and re-painted. The generous back deck has enough room for table, chairs and a bbq. The yard is private with an abundance of mixed plants and flowers perfect for the avid gardener. Sitting on the front veranda and watching the glorious sunsets over the bay would be one of your favourite things to do on the warm summer evenings. The property is in the perfect location, within 2 minutes drive to the water and amenities on offer at Grantville including Post Office, Chemist, Doctor, Ambulance Depot, Cafes, Bakery and more. Major shopping centres and Phillip Island are all within half an hour, and dual lane Bass Highway makes the commute easy to any destination.
