Is it style - modern, enticing and appealing? Is it space - two excellent sized living areas, four bedrooms and two bathrooms? Or perhaps it is the setting - a private yard with a paved outdoor BBQ area overlooking the sparkling in-ground pool nestled in a well maintained allotment of 881sqm (approx). Maybe it's car space you need - a double carport and a lockup garage.
So you see, whatever you're looking for, this home has a certain appeal inside and out which is sure to delight.","SOLD - $771,500","4

Enjoying picturesque views from its elevated, top-of-court position, this 4 bedroom brick veneer home is in perfect harmony with its surrounds. Large sliding doors provide an effortless transition between indoors and out, making it ideal for entertaining.
The split-level home commences with the living zone, where a lounge and dining room adjoins a family/meals room, both accessing the paved alfresco terrace and landscaped gardens. Angled timber-lined ceilings with fans complement polished Pine floorboards and a crisp colour scheme.
Adjoining a well-appointed laundry, the galley-style kitchen has been renovated to feature a stainless steel Westinghouse 900mm cooker and a Fisher and Paykel dual-drawer dishwasher, along with concealed microwave/appliance storage.
The first level features 2 bedrooms and 2 renovated bathrooms featuring rain showers and stone-topped vanities. The master bedroom enjoys a wall of fitted wardrobes, backyard access and an ensuite, while bedroom 2 adjoins the family bathroom with a bath. The top floor has another 2 bedrooms with views.
Highlights include: gas ducted heating, a split system air conditioning, Bosch temperature-controlled instant gas hot water, a garden shed and carport.
This blissfully quiet court lies in a coveted enclave near Eastfield Mall shops and restaurants, Ringwood East station, Maroondah Hospital and Cheong Park and Wildflower Sanctuary, with a short commute to Croydon, Eastland and EastLink access.
An adjacent laneway accesses a park with a playground and this light-filled home is within easy reach of Tintern Grammar, Tinternvale and Eastwood Primary Schools.
