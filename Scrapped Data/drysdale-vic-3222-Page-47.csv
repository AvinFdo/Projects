Sleeping quarters are well-sized and carpeted; two come with double built-in robes, and the master has 90-degree glazing. Outdoors, cottage-style garden beds represent scope for further development and landscaping, and vehicles can be securely parked in the double garage. A couple of garden sheds keep bikes and beach gear tucked away.
Just around the corner, the Emily Street Lake is home to an abundance of birdlife and is a delightful natural environment; Lake Victoria also provides a chance for outdoor adventures. Just a short walk to the school, village shops & golf course, this peaceful location is unaffected by summer tourism and is highly sought after. Land size 951sqm (approx.).","SOLD - $840,000","3
