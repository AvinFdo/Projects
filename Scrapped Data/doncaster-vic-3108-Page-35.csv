doncaster-vic-3108,13a Monaco Street Doncaster VIC 3108,"Designer style, five-star convenience.
Brand new with its own frontage, no common land and therefore no Body Corporate fees, secure your very own piece of Manningham with this ultra-contemporary residence of impressive proportions.
Whilst the address implies townhouse living, the reality is anything but, given this big and spacious family home boasts a generous collection of four large bedrooms (two with their own ensuite), three separate living areas and three luxurious bedrooms.
A chic interior with designer flair instantly appeals with its warm timber floors downstairs, soft carpet flooring upstairs and sleek square-set high ceilings throughout.
Introducing a peaceful rumpus, this contemporary head-turner flows past a luxurious guest bedroom (with ensuite and walk-in robe) before arriving at the breathtaking open-plan living area, where stacker doors retract to unite the sun-kissed setting with the desirable outdoor entertaining area set amidst a low maintenance landscaped rear yard.
A deluxe waterfall stone island bench accentuates the functionality of the five-star kitchen, and with quality stainless steel appliances, slimline cabinetry and an on-trend tiled splashback, an ultimate cooking experience awaits.
Indulge in the superior level of privacy afforded to the upstairs floorplan, where a central retreat acts as a thoughtful buffer between the large master bedroom and two robed bedrooms, while a fully-tiled bathroom with matte-black tapware, bath and a frameless shower adds a splash of luxury for all members of the household to enjoy.
Set on a low maintenance 364sqm (approx.) block with superior finishes, video intercom, split-system heating/cooling, secure off-street parking and loads of storage, this refined residence is also within walking distance of Village Ave shops, trendy Macedon Square, Manningham Medical Centre, direct bus to City from High St and minutes away from Westfield Shoppingtown, the Eastern Freeway, parks and well-regarded schools.","SOLD - $1,230,000","4

doncaster-vic-3108,67 Stanton Street Doncaster VIC 3108,"A Doncaster bargain...must inspect!
Solidly built with spacious living areas and fantastic multi-generational living options, this stately double storey, four-bedroom, three bathroom family home presents a compelling case for family living on a grand scale.
Space constraints will be an issue of the past, thanks to a well-kept floorplan that offers plenty of room for every member of the household. A basement self-contained living area complete with large open-plan lounge, generous wet bar kitchen, bedroom with ensuite & WIR, and outdoor access offers multiple options including excellent in law accommodation, teenagers retreat or income producing flat/home office. Excellent under stair storage suitable for a wine cellar is a bonus. Upstairs, the large formal lounge/dining, kitchen with Gaggenau appliances and a zoned accommodation wing, comprise a study, three robed bedrooms (master with fully-tiled ensuite) and a main family bathroom illustrates just how much space resides inside this quality family home.
A rooftop entertaining area will elevate your BBQ gatherings up a notch, while plantation window shutters, split-system heating/cooling, energy-efficient LED lighting, double garage with internal access and a generous backyard adds further appeal.
Capping off this fantastic family upsizer is its sought-after location, which sees the scenic Koonung Creek Trail, Wilsons Rd Reserve, Birralee Primary School and bus services within walking distance and the Eastern Freeway, the Park + Ride facility and Westfield Shoppingtown just moments away.

Sale By Set Date Tuesday 12th June at 6.00pm
Ideally situated in a quiet cul-de-sac in leafy Doncaster is this grandiose home offering luxury living on a spectacular scale. This decadent family living is bolstered by proximity to key amenities including Westfield Doncaster, Doncaster Secondary College and public transport options.

The butler's pantry is an added convenience, and there is an abundance of storage throughout the house. In the same zone as the kitchen is the main dining space which is bathed in natural light.
The main downstairs living area is compounded by the more formal, carpeted lounge in a separate wing of the home. There is also an upstairs studio providing large families with flexibility. Upstairs are four bedrooms, each with built-in robes and an ensuite in the master plus another bathroom with a double vanity. Additional benefits include the huge three-car garage plus a workstation, evaporative cooling, ducted heating and the property's own weather station.","SOLD - $2,000,000","5
