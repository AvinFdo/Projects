drysdale-vic-3222,34 Drakes Road DRYSDALE VIC 3222,"Rural Living with a Coastal Lifestyle
Over recent years, the desire to escape the confines of suburban pace have become more prevalent with city dwellers leaving their busy streets in droves. Seeking a quieter existence where the really important (and often simpler) aspects of life are addressed, hoards of Geelong, and even Melbourne, residents have trawled the internet, driven the rural roads and pestered the local agents in the hope of sourcing their own slice of country heaven. This is exactly the type of property they have been looking for!
Situated atop a gentle rise in an undulating landscape that is renowned for its fertility, this home arose out of love for the land and considered thought for the aspect, outlook and position. Practicality, though cleverly disguised amid the modest luxury of the home, was also featured heavily during the design process. Rooms are large, open and airy. Semi commercial windows fill the north facing walls allowing the landscape to penetrate into the interior of the home providing both warmth and an undeniably composed sense of calm. Living in this home, despite modern pressures, feels very much like you are exempt from buying into their demands.
Each of the 4 (beyond) King sized bedrooms enjoys an equally calm vista into the natural surrounds. You can only imagine that children will be quieter here; more content and easier pleased. Adults, with their own private retreat can indulge in the decadence of access to the patio leading to the IG 'does everything itself whizz bang' swimming pool as well as an ensuite inspired by the very best European 5 star hotels.
As a family, both indoor and outdoor gatherings are plentifully accommodated with a comfortable family room adjacent the truly stunning kitchen providing direct access to the extensive decked alfresco, or... hoards of children can play in the completely separate rumpus. No matter how many or how young/old, this home has been designed with family as the central focus. There is something here to please every single member! If you love to entertain, cooking in the gourmet kitchen will be a delight. If you love animals, the paddocks and natural creek can cater to all sorts. For green thumbs, the manicured garden is sure to get the gloves on and if you just enjoy the scenery and sounds, it doesn't matter where you are on this property, your dream will be fulfilled!
With a large shed still to be erected (and included in the sale), machinery, hobbies and fodder can be securely stored whilst vehicles are taken care of in the double garage attached to the home.
Words are really not enough to give an accurate impression of this property. To say it is serene seems inadequate. To say it is the very best quality; insufficient. To gain a proper understanding of this home's truth can only be achieved upon inspection but be warned...neither your heart, nor your head will ever want to leave!
* Quiet rural setting
* 4.2 acres of prime land
* Coastal Amenities, beaches, shops and schools close by
* Luxury Fittings including Turkish stone vanity basins
