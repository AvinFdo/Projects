Careful planning and execution has been well achieved, ensuring the home provides a modern, homely and comfortable haven for the family to enjoy.

Glass doors fold back and open up to a second living zone featuring bespoke cabinetry and ample room for family relaxation, as well as offering the opportunity to shut off the area for complete privacy and enjoyment of the space.
The kitchen not only looks amazing but also offers unrivalled functionality with a generous island bench, stainless steel appliances; 900mm dual-fuel cooker and dishwasher, stone benchtops, soft-close drawers and a view of the backyard to watch the kids while cooking. The two outdoor areas are both paved and offer superb entertaining space, with one of these located straight off the kitchen.
When it's time to relax and take care of you, the master is designed to do exactly that, featuring a fitted walk-in robe and fully renovated ensuite with a luxury-sized frameless shower, wall-hung vanity and large format floor-to-wall tiles. Three additional robed bedrooms are generously sized, plus the home also includes a fully decked out study complete with a built-in cupboard, desk, shelves and drawers-perfectly suitable as a professional home office.
The on-trend, space-saving Euro laundry is a highlight of the home, in addition to inclusions such as; gas ducted heating, evaporative cooling, ceiling fans (all bedrooms), storage cupboard, high ceilings throughout, ornate cornices, well insulated, under-house storage and apple trees.

From the moment you enter this stunning, contemporary, single level abode you are instantly greeted by light filled spaces and the notable finishes of the highest quality from top to bottom.
Positioned within a quiet and friendly street, at the rear of just two on the block with house-like dimensions, space has not been compromised and the effortless flow of the open floor plan will appease a variety of buying requirements including downsizers, first home buyers and investors alike.
The floorplan features a good sized front living room with large windows allowing an abundance of natural light, flowing through to the stunning well-appointed kitchen complete with high-gloss cabinetry, porcelain tiles, Bosch & Blanco stainless steel appliances, soft-close draws, plenty of cupboard and bench space, and an adjoining family meals area.
Three good sized bedrooms, all with built in robes, are serviced by the well-positioned main bathroom that can only be described as a work of art, featuring the new and very stylish ""Wet Room"" look, with a rainfall shower head and LED lights that change colour with the temperature, soft close drawer unit with ample storage, generous bath and a beautiful oval vanity bowl that sits atop an amazing handpicked and crafted wood bench top.
Spilling out through glass sliding doors off the dining area, youll find an expansive full-length Merbau deck, perfect for entertaining all year round, and is complemented by beautiful gardens and tranquil water feature.
Added bonuses include polished floorboards throughout, gas ducting heating, evaporative cooling, no body corporate fees, double car garage with rear access and space outside for two more cars, and a private courtyard that would also be suitable for storing boats, caravans, trucks or trailers.
The location completes the package, being within walking distance to everything that this suburb has to offer, including just 900 meters to Bayswater Station and shops, as well as primary and secondary schools, plus being a short distance from Eastland, Westfield Knox and the major road arterials.
Opportunities of this stature seldom become available in todays market; an inspection is the only way to truly reveal the magnitude of what is being offered.
