clayton-south-vic-3169,695 Heatherton Road Clayton South VIC 3169,"AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENT SITE!
ATTENTION ALL DEVELOPERS AND INVESTORS, This property on approximately 1226 m2 of land is ideal for multiple townhouse development (Subject to Council Approval).
The real estate market in Clayton South is going from strength to strength and with the central Clayton market becoming almost out of reach, we see this opportunity as one to seriously consider.
The home has seen better days so it's all about the land here.
Well positioned, and in close proximity to Monash Freeway, Dingley Bypass, Springvale Shopping Centre and home maker centre (IKEA), Westall Train Station and Dingley shops also.
Feel free to contact us for more information.
