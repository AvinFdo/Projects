connewarre-vic-3227,460 Merrawarp Road Barrabool VIC 3221,"Under offer
This stunning Barrabool sandstone and weatherboard residence (circa 1861) provides a rare opportunity with over 150 years of history, character and individuality to create your own piece of history by further renovating and adding your stamp to this unique residence. Originally built by pioneer Swiss vignerons, this property has historical significance for its associations with the winemaking industry in colonial Victoria, and the breathtaking cellar transports us back in time. Neuchatel covers approximately two acres and is located in the prestigious rolling hills of Barrabool, just a stones throw from the Ceres township where peace and tranquillity is the way of life.
While a new extension would enhance the size, this gorgeous cottage currently comprises three bedrooms with original features. Master bedroom with a deep-set colonial window creates a very special ambience and charm, two childrens bedrooms, a functional family bathroom, a simple and light-filled kitchen that looks out to the yard, separate sitting room and a large north-facing dining and lounge with polished floorboards and fireplaces. French doors open to a verandah and alfresco deck thats ideal for outdoor living and entertaining. A stunning and unique feature of this residence is the 3x6 metre sandstone basement cellar.
Surrounded by a manicured hedged garden and century-old trees, outdoor features include an original coach house and stables, minor sheds, vegetable gardens, childrens play area, original Chasselas grapevine and 50,000 litres of water storage.
With a bus stop to private schools directly outside the property, easy access to Highton Village shops and cafes, Geelong CBD and the Surf Coast, and one hour to Melbourne CBD via the Ring Road, Neuchatel is ideally located to maximise all the benefits of country living, while being close to amenities.
Move in today and soak up the history, or put your own special mark on the property with opportunities to renovate and extend.
