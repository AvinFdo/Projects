clifton-hill-vic-3068,1/16 The Esplanade Clifton Hill VIC 3068,"Parkland Views
Every once in a while, you have the opportunity to purchase something a little rarer and more desirable than is commonly offered. This type of property tends to be tightly held and infrequently offered for sale, opportunity is now knocking.
One of only a few select Clifton Hill ground floor apartments offering unimpeded parkland views ideal for a downsizer or owner occupier wishing to avoid hiking up and down stairs.
Located adjacent to the delightful environs of picturesque Yarra River parkland you’ll not only enjoy a natural setting but also have a diverse range of eateries, fresh produce/specialty shopping of Queens Parade and a myriad of transport options all close at hand. A lifestyle rather than just an apartment awaits you.
Infinitely comfortable as is, but with significant scope for improvement the apartment comprises formal entry hall, sizeable lounge with access to private balcony, functional but basic kitchen/meals, bathroom with shower over bath, laundry facilities, separate toilet, 2 double bedrooms with built in robes and single off-street car space.","SOLD - $540,000","2
