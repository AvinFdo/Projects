A grand entrance boasting 10 foot ceilings, polished floorboards and ornate timber windows frames featuring led lights sets the theme for this former beauty!! 3 spacious bedrooms are complimented by 2 separate living areas and a kitchen meals area. The formal lounge with high ceilings, polished floorboards and an ornamental fire place steps directly onto a rear decking area which takes in glimpses of bay/water views. A separate casual lounge is currently used as a sitting area/library. A modernised kitchen/meals area catches more glimpses of the bay. The bathroom is a generous space but certainly put its hand up for some renovation and 'work'! We cannot escape the fact this charming weatherboard with Californian Bungalow influences requires some 'roll up your sleeves hard work' but it offers a great opportunity for the savvy property speculator.","SOLD - $292,500","3

It is very relaxing"" Although it may need you to add your own touches what you start with is neat and compact. Extending the home is always an option too. Clifton Springs is a vibrant community where you can enjoy a lifestyle of work, rest and play. All amenities needed are all close at hand.
