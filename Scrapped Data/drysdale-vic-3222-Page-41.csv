drysdale-vic-3222,24 Marsh Court Drysdale VIC 3222,"Plenty of Room for EVERYTHING!
It is not just the home that is huge, the north facing entertaining deck is quite literally enormous, the double garage has a third bay of workshop space and the land it all sits on is approximately 1096m2 in size,. All this is within walking distance of the town centre and local schools, in a quiet court location opposite the beautiful Drysdale Reserve and sporting facilities.
Just a few years young, the contemporary design of this home offers oodles of space for your family with an open plan design that provides maximum versatility. 4 flowing living areas including lounge, meals, family and rumpus zones, all take advantage of the north sun so they are light, airy and perfect for formal and informal recreation and relaxation. With most new homes nowadays opting for galley style kitchens, the unusually spacious style of this one sits beautifully in the centre of the home and boasts other features such as granite benchtops, 900mm Technika appliances, dual drawer dishwasher, pot drawers galore and a walk in pantry...truly a foodie's delight!
The study at the front of the home would be perfect for home based businesses whilst the master suite next door is the epitome of WOW! With its own private outdoor deck, ensuite with double vanity, separate wc and double shower plus a walk in robe, it is everything you could ever ask for as the ultimate parent's retreat. A further 3 queen sized bedrooms have built in robes with access to a completely functional family bathing area with double vanity, shower/bath room and wc all contained within their own zones to enable multiple simultaneous use.
The top quality specification is evident throughout with polished timber floors, designer lighting in addition to an abundance of mood creating downlighting, extra ceiling height and wet area tiling. The outdoor space is amazing and incorporates both undercover and landscaped open air entertaining area, low maintenance garden beds plus a huge rear yard with garden sheds and plenty of room for summer cricket or football matches for all the family...
