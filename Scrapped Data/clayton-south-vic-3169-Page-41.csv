clayton-south-vic-3169,7 Culshaw Avenue CLAYTON SOUTH VIC 3169,"A great renovation or development opportunity (STCA)
There is plenty of potential in this weatherboard home with a large garage/workshop and separate bungalow, but for many it will be all about the land and what can be done with it.
Currently tenanted and offering instant income, the home could easily be renovated with existing features including a spacious lounge room, extended family room at the rear and a central kitchen with gas oven/stove and an adjoining meals area. All 3 bedrooms feature built in wardrobes and there is also a family bathroom, a second shower room and toilet for added convenience. Ducted heating is also included and outside you find a generous garage/workshop with room for up to 3 cars and a partitioned office area as well as a separate bungalow or storage area. But with around 771sqm of flat land, there is certainly development potential here with either a luxurious new family home or up to 3 units possible (STCA). The location will be popular too with buses at the end of the street, Westall primary and secondary schools around the corner while Westall train station and Rosebank Avenue shops within walking distance.

clayton-south-vic-3169,2/21 Bevan Avenue Clayton South VIC 3169,"Viva La Villa!
Nesters and investors get out your cheque book because this two-bedroom villa represents value-added buying! Factor in the peaceful location, and that there are only three residences on the block, and that it's low maintenance living here, and that the home has a flowing floorplan plus a private, paved courtyard at the rear. See how the advantages add up! Note the relaxing living room, the eat-in kitchen, the built-in wardrobes in the bedrooms, the separate laundry, the carport... Best of all you can walk to the train station from here; reserves, shops, recreation and schools are nearby; Monash Medical Centre is in handy distance; and Monash University is easily accessed. The villa might benefit from a little TLC - but there's no need to rush. Meanwhile live in or let out - and count the benefits.
