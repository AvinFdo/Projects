Whether its investment returns, 1st home or an easy-care lifestyle you're on the hunt for, there is no finer location than in this blue-chip South Yarra cul-de-sac abutting beautiful Como Park and the Yarra river precinct. Sitting on the 1st floor of a proudly maintained block with peace of mind assured thanks to intercom entry and remote gates to your carport, this surprising apartment is a wonderful place to call home with over-sized rooms, lots of north/westerly light and leafy outlooks over the streetscape treetops.

Comprising 2 large north-facing bedrooms (main with wall-to-wall BIRs, 1/BIRs), over-sized bathroom (separate WC and separate laundry), lots of storage in the well-appointed and house-sized kitchen and lovely big lounge and adjoining dining area open to a pretty treetops balcony. Great buying in the heart of one of Melbourne's premier suburbs complete with air-conditioner, large storeroom and easy proximity to trams and trains.","SOLD - $910,000","2
