cockatoo-vic-3781,20 Station Avenue Emerald VIC 3782,"Deceased Estate - Ready to be Renewed and Reloved
Built in 1973 this solid brick home on acre (approx.) was thoughtfully designed to see it through the passage of time. It has been well loved and well cared for and now is its time to be reborn with the love of a new family. It sits in peace and seclusion in a tightly held pocket, right next to Emerald Lake Park and opposite Puffing Billy track. There is a horseshoe drive with ample room for cars including carports for 3.
The house is clearly in need of an update but there is nothing but personal taste to stop a family living here immediately. The bones of this house are strong. The open plan kitchen/informal meals area is prescient of modern taste and with the sink perfectly positioned beneath a large garden window, doing dishes here will never be a chore.
Potential is a word never far from your mind as you note the original features in the study, large family bathroom and spacious laundry. The formal dining room adjoins the lounge, both are a good size and filled with light and greenery courtesy of the enormous full length triple windows on 3 walls. For comfort there is a fully functioning fireplace and both gas ducted heating and evaporative cooling. The 3 bedrooms include a small double with BIR. A full sized double looking out into the lush mature gardens. The master suite has everything you need apart from a modern aesthetic. It features a door leading to the private fern garden, a large walk in wardrobe and a full ensuite.
Don't forget to bring a tape measure and colour palette to the open for inspection.","SOLD - $705,000","4
