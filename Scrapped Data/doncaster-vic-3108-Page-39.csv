doncaster-vic-3108,1 Curnola Avenue Doncaster VIC 3108,"An avenue of opportunity.
All options will be considered when it comes to deciding the fate of this potential-rich three-bedroom home inside the Birralee Primary School and Templestowe College catchment area.
Set on an outstanding 728sqm (approx.) block with city views, developing the block with multiple dwellings (STCA) is an avenue worth exploring, particularly when you consider your brand new creation will stand within footsteps of Village Ave shops and bus services and moments from Macedon Square, the Park + Ride, the Eastern Freeway, Westfield Shoppingtown and local schools.
Utilising the property as a revenue-generating rental is another smart option, particularly whilst awaiting plan and permit approval from council. And, of course, there's no reason why you couldn't move your young family straight in and enjoy the home's pristine presentation, sun-kissed living with polished timber floorboards, excellent timber kitchen, fresh family bathroom, generous-sized bedrooms, large grassed backyard and benefits of evaporative cooling and ducted heating.
So, what does your vision look like?","SOLD - $1,600,000","3

Pristine in presentation, grand in its proportions and faultless in its peaceful location, this secure four-bedroom family haven represents an easy choice for those contemplating where next to call home.
Spanning across two exciting levels with formal and communal living spaces and zoned accommodation serviced by stylishly renovated bathrooms, move your growing family straight in and enjoy one of Manningham's most rewarding family lifestyles.
The essence of family is very much at the heart of this proud home, and it shows with the central placement of the enormous cook's kitchen.

The impressive size and scale of the bright family living allows the entire family to unwind with space and comfort, while a carpeted formal lounge with a peaceful front garden aspect offers a private setting to gather your thoughts in isolation.
A saltwater-chlorinated/solar-heated swimming pool with spa reinvigorates your senses and gives the home serious entertaining credentials, while enclosed front gardens are park-like in presentation and offer immediate respite from the daily grind.
The home's upper level comfortably accommodates all four bedrooms (large master with renovated ensuite and built-in robes), while two renovated bathrooms (one on each level), downstairs study, stately entrance with lavish lighting, large laundry, ducted refrigerated cooling and heating, ducted vacuum, brand new wool carpet, loads of storage and a double garage add further appeal to this remarkable home.
Standing within the Birralee Primary School and Koonung Secondary College catchment area, your growing family will also enjoy the lifestyle advantages of living within swift access of the Park + Ride, the Eastern Freeway/Eastlink, Village Ave shops, Macedon Square, the Greythorn shopping and dining strip, Westfield Shoppingtown, the Koonung Creek Trail and elite Kew private schools.","SOLD - $1,720,000","4
