Due to COVID-19 Regulations, Inspections are by appointment only. Wearing of masks and social distancing apply. Contact agent to organise a time.
Looks can be deceiving, there is more behind the door of this home than what you would expect when you do a drive by. Not only one living area but two, not only three bedrooms but the option of a fourth or study.
The back yard is also larger than you would imagine too. Rarely do the kid's balls go over the fence. If they do itâs a very big kick! Vegie patches exist to feed the ever growing family. Enjoy the Undercover entertainment area with a view of the pretty garden and lush green grass.
The current owners have enjoyed being close to all the open spaces and parks for the kids to run. They have enjoyed being close to the water all year round. They are likely to remain in the area as it offers all they require plus more.
There is a choice of schools, medical centres, sporting clubs, dance groups, but wait there's more: Restaurants, cafes, bike trails etc. One of the many highlights of living here is the Bellarine Tourist Railway. Runs from Queenscliff to Drysdale on weekends and during the week in the school holidays.
What is your wish list for a home? Are you looking to downsize, buy your first home or invest? This home would be the perfect solution for any of the above options.
Tucked behind a high fence on a 609m2 (approx) it is a very quiet place to escape to.

The eye to detail in this delightful, compact cottage is truly inspiring. The owners have not left a stone unturned creating ""Beachwood Cottage"" through savvy design and an artisan-built interior.
Maintaining a single garage at the front, the elevated entrance presents a central passage, with subtle oak flooring (the oak being a constant recurring theme throughout the cabinetry and fittings).
Behind sliding doors, the west side of the passage features a Euro-style laundry, a powder room, a bathroom with shower and heated towel rail, and two separate WC's and vanities. On the east side, two bedrooms enjoy garden views through finely-crafted sash windows, plus built-in robes. At the rear, a cosy kitchen/dining/lounge opens onto a covered deck that's primed for alfresco entertainment. The kitchen features state-of-the-art Miele appliances including integrated fridge/freezer and dishwasher, and the laid-back lounge overlooks a neat, low-maintenance native garden and rear shed. There's also an outside shower and water tank, and a single garage with great storage space.
Little expense has been spared - with numerous luxury fittings, subtle contemporary lighting, ducted heating and cooling throughout. This fully insulated home is complemented by a beautifully landscaped native garden including irrigation system. A further undoubted bonus is the cottage's location - right beside a large nature park and playground.

Due to COVID-19 Regulations, inspections are by appointment only. Wearing of masks and social distancing apply. Contact agent to organise a time.
As we do life circumstances change and decisions need to be made. My Vendor has thoroughly enjoyed living here but now it's time for a change.
The lounge and dining room are on the west side of the home to benefit from the afternoon sun and provide a bright and cosy atmosphere. This central living zone features a gas wall heater as well as a split system A/C. The big draw card of the property is that the master bedroom has a WIR and an ensuite bathroom which is very rarely seen in this price bracket.
Being the rear unit it is discreetly tucked away from the street so road noise will never be a problem. The car will be secure in the single lock up garage.
Clifton Springs is a suburb on the edge of Corio Bay so if you enjoy walking a stroll down to the water's edge will reveal the You Yangs and the large ships moving in and out for the Bay. Yachts really enjoy this bay too. Enquire today for your private inspection.

The house has a master bedroom with fitted built in robes, ensuite double shower, separate toilet. Walk from the master to a separate under cover deck with amazing views to the East;
The sunrise is something to be seen to believe.
The other two bedrooms with adjoining bathroom with separate shower and bath again with
separate toilet room are in a private part of the house, which is ideal for guests, but also lends itself
to B&B possibilities.

Back to why it is special, walk to the many beautiful restaurants and café's not to mention Daniels Donuts.
