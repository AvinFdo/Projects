Living space is in abundance thanks to the tiled open plan family room at the front and the enormous family room at the rear. This fabulous room is so spacious and has enough flexibility that it will house your couches and tv, kids toys and a pool table – all separately but at once! The sizeable central kitchen overlooks the dining and family area, and is in fantastic order for now until its time to update down the track! There is plenty of cupboard and bench space available, and the dining area is conveniently close and generous in size. Temperature control is provided thanks to ducted heated and cooling, whilst other features include excellent storage capabilities, and double auto garage at the front
A fully established and manageable 686m2 block is all set up and ready to enjoy immediately. If you love outdoor entertaining, then you will be delighted with what's on offer here!

At the end of a quiet court bowl rests this North facing, solid, well built four bedroom property. Upon entry you have the bedroom wing to the right. Offering two bathrooms and a good sized master with large built in robes and a picture window filtering copious amounts of natural light. Family bathroom with spa bath and all the other features you would expect.
Towards the heart of the home you will certainly be surprised by the size of the open plan kitchen meals and lounge. Beyond generous in proportions; it makes for a special bright light filled space. New floor coverings and recent updates provide you with a sense of security, privacy and neighbourhood community which is immediately noticeable in this pocket in Kangaroo Flat.
Throughout; features refrigerative cooling and gas ducted heating plus the ambience of a solid fuel heater in the large lounge. The U shaped kitchen with cork tiles allows for families or those to entertain in a great space. Single garage and workshop bench provide benefits for those handy on the tools or as a great storage area. 2.5kw of solar cuts down on the energy bills as a huge plus. Under house storage is also a must mention.
The garden surrounds have been landscaped for ease of use and low maintenance. A quaint little front paved sunny tiled patio gives you an extra outdoor sitting area. Inspection is a must.","SOLD - $305,000","4

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,34 Irontree Close Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Existing to please
Affordable, established, spacious and conveniently situated, this property embodies all the reasons why there's no need to build anew. An unimpeded line of sight from front door to rear boundary further instils the sense of space that is immediately apparent upon entry. On opposite sides of the kitchen-meals area, the 2 living zones can be separated from each other simply by closing a hallway door, a family harmony enhancer so often not included in new builds these days. Owning a walk-in pantry, plus a long island breakfast bar thoughtfully equipped with power points, the kitchen is perfectly positioned to host a party. Stainless steel appliances include a new dishwasher, and there will be no need to worry whether your fridge will fit with the consideration given to that thought here. Possessing dimensions demanding status as a true parental retreat, the substantial master bedroom reserves an ideal position for a chaise or cosy sofa within a bay window. Twin vanity and a 1200mm shower plus a walk-in robe complete this serene scene. Double door built-in robes belong to 2 more big bedrooms that sit either side of a study nook and family bathroom with spa. To manage local weather extremes, gas heating and evaporative cooling are ducted throughout the home. However, expenses on utilities will be minimised by the 4kw solar panels, as well as a 2000 litre rainwater tank that is connected to the toilets. Mostly giving the chilly southerly weather the cold shoulder of brickwork, the residence optimises a north-easterly aspect with large windows capturing winter sunlight, also saving energy on heating. Glass sliding doors link the family room with an undercover alfresco area that adjoins extensive paving. Established landscaping encompasses retaining walls, mulched areas, veggie patches, shrubs, plus ground covers and there's a garden shed to stow the mower. Alongside the double garage that has direct entry indoors, side gates allow secure off-street parking of a trailer, boat or caravan in the well-fenced backyard. Commuters will appreciate less than a 10 minute cycle to the train station and central Bendigo is 7 kilometres from this address. Four doors from a bus stop, it's also close to a community health centre, schools, shopping, services and sporting facilities. Forest Lake is only 200 metres away and Bendigo Regional Park not much more. A wonderful opportunity to start new traditions of family bushwalks and picnics, or a regular routine of escaping for some quiet time and a brisk walk, the location is terrific too.","SOLD - $335,000","3
