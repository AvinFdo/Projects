kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,9 Hope Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Property with potential every which way.
This property has potential written all over it. It's a win–win situation whichever way you look at it.
First is the location - a quiet no-through street close to schools, supermarket, High Street shopping, the soon-to-be new pool, parklands, sporting facilities and public transport.
Second - the level block measures approximately 1,090 square metres.
Third - the three bedroom home has recently gone a total makeover with new kitchen and bathroom featuring new vanity unit, shower and modern tiles. Find a split system air conditioning and polished timber floors throughout the kitchen, adjoining dining area, front lounge and entry hall with new carpets in the bedrooms. A spacious, separately located family living room includes big windows overlooking the back yard, gas wall furnace and ceiling fan. The house is in great shape and ready for immediate occupation.
But there's more - a fully self-contained unit in the backyard includes bedroom with ensuite, living area and kitchenette. It is in need of some TLC to bring it up to scratch, but it does have options – restore for extended family, lease out for extra income or sell off as a relocatable and develop the site which has no heritage or planning overlays (STCA).

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,6 O'Dea Crescent Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Perfect Family Home or Investment
Spacious and bright living, loads of extras outdoors plus a handy position are just 3 of the many reasons to make this property the next to inspect. A unique 3-bedroom floorplan offers a refreshingly sensible design, where rooms flow naturally with the rhythm of family life. Ducted evaporative cooling, gas heaters along with reverse cycle air conditioning provide efficient and effective year round comfort.
Flanked by 2 living areas and adjoining the dining room, the kitchen possesses a gas stove and wall oven plus a double door pantry. Loads of bench-space separates an abundance of cupboards. Further storage found elsewhere includes twin linen presses, built-in robes in 2 bedrooms and walk-in robe to the main bedroom which also has an ensuite. Just off the family room, the undercover alfresco living soaks up winter sunshine from a north-easterly aspect.
A generous block size of 837m2 and corner positioning grants bonus side access from Paula Court to the fully fenced backyard.
This enables choice of vehicle entry into the 4 x 7.5 metre shed with concrete floor and power, garage and carport, handy for secure shelter of not just cars but also a caravan, boat and/or trailer. Adjoining the residence, the garage has a remote-controlled roller door, direct entry indoors via the laundry and a huge workshop space which provides plenty of room for hobbies too.
Commuters can catch the train or drive to Melbourne.
Schools, amenities, shopping, buses and services are all nearby this fab location. So whether investing, finding a first home or a forever home this property certainly has mass appeal.","SOLD - $325,000","3

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,192 High Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Classic Clinker in Prime Position
Positioned on a beautiful tree-lined service road, this original 1950s clinker brick home occupies a 630sqm (approx.) allotment among other desirable homes in a fantastic location. If you're seeking a property within walking distance to all amenities including bus and train services, doctors, schools, sporting complexes, parks and entertainment, then you could not be in a better spot on the Melbourne side of Bendigo. There are also further opportunities to renovate or extend the home (STCA).
Architecturally, this structure is very solid and the interior is well maintained and spotless. A fantastic job has been done in combining old and new to attractively rejuvenate the home, creating an inviting space.
Some of the benefits of the renovation include; a fresh coat of paint, new window furnishings and new floor coverings in the kitchen, meals and laundry area.
As you enter the home you'll be impressed with the well-designed layout; kitchen, meals, laundry and living space to the right, with bedrooms and family bathroom to the left. The kitchen is bright and welcoming and offers ample bench space and cupboard storage. There is a 4-burner gas cooktop, an electric wall oven and a dishwasher. The laundry is conveniently located just off the kitchen and has plenty of bench and cupboard space. The living room is a generous size and has a beautiful big window that keeps the space well lit and offers views to the front garden.
The 3 bedrooms are also quite spacious; one having a BIR and the remaining rooms have sufficient space for either freestanding robes or BIRs to be added. The 3 piece family bathroom is quite roomy and consists of a large 900x1200ml shower, updated vanity and toilet. The bathroom is certainly wheelchair friendly, as is the rest of house. Heating and cooling is easily controlled year round with ducted gas heating and evaporative air conditioning. The combination of 9ft ceilings and ceiling fans in kitchen/dining area and first bedroom make a dramatic reduction to summer temperatures, even without the air conditioner. There is also a gas heater in the original fireplace in the living room.
There are lovely established hedges and trees in the front garden, concrete driveway and paths, pergola area, single brick garage with entry to separate workshop and garden shed.
This property is ideal for a family to occupy, first home buyers or an investor looking to grow their portfolio. Don't delay inspection of this stunning property.","SOLD - $288,000","3
