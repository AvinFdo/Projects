officer-vic-3809,40 Tolkien Boulevard Officer VIC 3809,"BRAND NEW OPPOSITE PRISTINE PARKLANDS
""Set for auction but prior offers before are highly encouraged.""
Brand new, located at the frontier of Officer's expansion, the property is literally within walking distance from schools, shops and train station. It's also perfectly positioned, only moments from the lake and adjacent to beautiful parkland.
This could not come at a better time for you. If you're a first-home-buyer not only will you save on stamp duty but you're also in line to receive the $10,000 rebate. As an investor you can expect seven complete years worth of depreciation.
Featuring:
- Four bedrooms, master with en-suite.
- Modern kitchen;
- Open plan living and dining room;
- Double car garage with internal access.
- Ducted heating.
- Landscaping and gardens already complete - ready for you to move in.
Given the low-maintenance yard, the house presents as an ideal investment and with such a family-friendly layout why would any first-home-buyer want to pass this up?
All of this could be yours within 30 days.","SOLD - $530,000","4
