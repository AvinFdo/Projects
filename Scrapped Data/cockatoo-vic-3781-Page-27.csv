cockatoo-vic-3781,40 Springs Street COCKATOO VIC 3781,"CLASSY COCKATOO
This property is as pleasant as Cockatoo is peaceful.
Naturally you'll be pleased with the four bedrooms, two separate living areas, massive garage/shed and manual climate control but it's the extras that emulate the homely feel.
Our vendors love to cook so it comes as no surprise the kitchen is the pride and joy of the house. 900mm stainless steel appliances and loads of bench space make for a functional kitchen while the hand-made boutique cupboards add a quaint touch.
Just last month the house spectacularly transformed. New tiling, fresh paint and a front yard makeover gives the house a vibrant look. The recent renovations have expanded the dwelling to 18 squares with a new master bedroom that includes walk-in robe and en suite.
The flat 1533sqm (approx) block features a patio, a veggie patch and fruit orchard that caters for potato, lemon, asparagus and other various types of fruit while leaving room to kick the footy.","SOLD - $410,000","4
