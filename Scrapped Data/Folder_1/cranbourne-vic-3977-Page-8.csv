cranbourne-vic-3977,2/14 Codrington Street Cranbourne VIC 3977,"**SOLD BY KALEN SUNDRAM**
CRANBOURNE CENTRAL: The key to the appeal of this street front unit is its amenity-filled location set directly opposite shops and within walking distance of Cranbourne Park Shopping Centre, Cranbourne Primary / Secondary Schools and even the local train station!
Second to that is the stunning original condition that the property has been kept in throughout its lifespan. The lucky new owner has the opportunity to update and renovate to add both modern styling and additional value to their new home or investment. If not simply move in, unpack and enjoy as it has been for the past 40 or so years!
Behind the secure front fence and the covered front porch that shields the classic brick facade, you will find a generous floorplan that boasts a lot more space than meets the eye. There's a generous lounge/dining area with gas heating that is complemented by an immaculate kitchen complete with upright electric oven/stove plus an included meals area.
There are 2 robed bedrooms, including an oversized master, as well as a very neat bathroom with separate toilet.
Step outside and be greeted by a private and easy to maintain courtyard together with a rear set single lock-up garage!
If you believe in the age-old theory that good real estate revolves around a central location then you won't be disappointed. Within moments to Narre Warren - Cranbourne Road, providing direct access to the shopping facilities situated at Thompsons Parkway, Casey Central and the Hunt Club Village, plus South Gippsland Highway enroute to a host of additional amenities. Those that don't drive can take advantage of the local bus stop literally metres away!
This is bound to walk out the door so don't delay!
BOOK AN INSPECTION TODAY, IT MAY BE GONE TOMORROW - PHOTO ID REQUIRED AT OPEN FOR INSPECTIONS!
Please note: Our floor plans are for representational purposes only and should be used as such. We accept no liability for the accuracy or details contained in our floor plans.

cranbourne-vic-3977,109 Lesdon Avenue Cranbourne VIC 3977,"**UNDER OFFER / UNDER CONTRACT**
RANGEBANK ESTATE, CRANBOURNE: A complete package with neutral tones and sleek contemporary appointments throughout, this enviable 3 bedroom home is teeming with lifestyle appeal for starters, families and downsizers.
Instantly impressing, off the formal entry way the single level layout reveals a stunning open plan living and dining room with soft carpeting, timber floorboards and a chic hostess kitchen complete with stainless steel appliances and generous amounts of counter space.
Just in time for the balmy weather, beyond sliding glass doors you'll discover the expansive pergola area with extensive decking providing a villa-like ambiance. The generous garden beyond hints at the potential for future subdivision or why not add a swimming pool and bask in the good life (both subject to council approval). For those looking for oversized car accommodation or space to construct the ideal man cave (both also subject to council approval) then this gem is an immediate addition to your short list!
The very comfortable bedrooms are each serviced by built in robes and a designer bathroom offering floor to ceiling tiling, walk in shower and a freestanding egg shaped tub beckoning for 'end of the day' bubble baths. It even includes a handy lit niche to hold your glass of wine!
A tidy laundry, separate toilet, ducted heating, evaporative cooling, roller blinds with pelmets, garden shed and paved off street parking ensure that all of the little creature comforts are instantly ticked off the checklist!
Set upon a spacious 654m2 (approx.) allotment that directly backs onto Lawson Pool Reserve the location is second to none. Within paces of Rangebank Primary School and the local kindergarten you are also in close proximity to buses, Merinda Park train station, Lyndhurst Secondary and the recently revamped Thompson Road en route to Marriott Waters, the Cranbourne Home Maker Centre and the Cranbourne Park Shopping Centre. This quiet position also affords a lovely lifestyle for retirees, whilst the app. 45 minute drive to the CBD is sure to suit commuters!
With the turnover in this popular estate at an all time low don't delay or else you will miss out!
