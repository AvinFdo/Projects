clifton-springs-vic-3222,9 Wanawong Court Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"Modern Tranquility!
A peaceful court location, a picturesque land holding of approximately 668m2 and beautiful established gardens provide a truly tranquil setting for this quality built 'home' which has undergone a renovation of the highest calibre. Only on inspection will you get a true appreciation of the clever design features, a healthy respect for yester year and uncompromising 'top shelf' finishes throughout.
• This delightful home sits effortlessly in its green leafy environment; the lovely earthy tones of the brick work further enhance this lovely feature.
• Upon entry it will become evident this beautifully appointed residence shares the truly special quality of creating a seamless inside/outside connection. A clever orientation and wonderful use of windows ensures a light and bright experience and a consistent link to the established garden settings.
• 4 generous bedrooms; the master is complete with ensuite, walk in robe and a ceiling fan. 3 additional bedrooms create a guest wing and are serviced by a family bathroom.
• A standout feature of this fine property is dual living areas of grand proportions.
• An eye catching kitchen has been born from a comprehensive 'spare no expense' renovation; it 'serves up' stylish contemporary finishes yet still 'nails' the brief for functionality. Expansive 50mm stone bench tops, custom cabinetry (soft close drawers and press touch cupboards), wine cooler, 900mm Smeg gas cook top and stainless steel appliances provide just a hint of what can be expected. A casual family lounge extends out to a paved alfresco zone via a glass sliding door; the canopy of an established wisteria tree provides lovely shade in the summer and is simply stunning when in full bloom.
• A formal lounge/dining possesses a warm and welcoming feel; a Jetmaster wood fireplace takes pride of place along with a stainless steel ceiling fan. A corner set window once again frames the lovely garden setting.
• A double remote car garage and additional off street vehicle accommodation further endorses the property's user friendly nature.
• An impressive 5kw solar power system is a substantial capital improvement and ensures this property ticks all the boxes.
• A must for an inspection if you desire a 'home' in every sense of the word!","SOLD - $565,000","4

clifton-springs-vic-3222,8 Waterford Place Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"Big Vistas For A Big Family
This is one of those rare homes with the “X” factor. In this case, a view that most home owners can only dream about. To say it’s spectacular is to sell it short. Located at one of the prime high points in Clifton Springs, the panorama stretches from west to east, taking in Leopold, Geelong and its harbour, the You Yangs and sparkling Port Phillip Bay. The large, 2-storey house itself is at the top end of Waterford Place, with an elevated driveway to a covered carport and single garage beyond. On the ground floor are four good-sized bedrooms, a bathroom and laundry. Upstairs the views really start to kick in, beginning with the huge open-plan kitchen/dining/loungerooms (there are two side-by-side) where a sliding door takes you to a west-facing deck that is a complete natural for alfresco entertaining. The well-equipped kitchen has an Omega electric oven and gas cooktop, plus a Dishlex dishwasher and a walk-in pantry. Adjacent is the dining area and then the two loungerooms - the second with a high gabled ceiling and a slow-combustion wood heater. Next door is the master bedroom, with a generous walk-in dressing room and a view to take your breath away. Currently, a neighbouring room is used as a nursery, but could be easily converted to an ensuite bathroom. The main bathroom, with shower and vanity, is located next to an office/study, which potentially could be another bedroom. Off this room is a second elevated deck that basks in the northern sunshine and provides an exciting alternative outdoor dining
option - and overlooks the rear lawn and garden shed. A spectacular coastal lifestyle awaits a truly fortunate family. Inspect today.","SOLD - $722,000","5

clifton-springs-vic-3222,9 Bundarra Street Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"THE SECRET'S OUT.
It's what you don't see from the street that makes this home so appealing. 9 Bundarra St Clifton Springs presents beautifully, inside and out. Clipped standard Lily Pillies, Viburnum and English Box hedges welcome you to this family brick home built in 1985. Upon entering the home you're in the living room, however the large windows allow the outdoors in. Let the sunshine in. Warmed with free standing gas fire with additional split system heating cooling keeps the home comfortable year round. The kitchen has been recently updated while the dining area has splendid views of the garden. All 3 bedrooms are a generous size, all with built in robes. The master bedroom has a full ensuite. Plenty of storage options abound. Nearly 50m2 of undercover patio will be the envy of family and friends. It's an outdoor living room. Surrounded by a much loved garden full of azaleas, camellias and other hardy perennials. Raised garden beds frame the resilient couch lawn on the 605m2 block. A 15m2 tin shed hides one of 2 tanks holding over 3,000L combined, both fitted with pumps that irrigate the garden through the warmer months. Many of the custom made metal artwork and light boxes will remain with the property for you to enjoy. The current owners are out of here! They're loading up the motor home and heading off, who knows where. You have the opportunity to benefit from all of their hard work. This home will be auctioned on Saturday 13th of October unless sold prior.
Clifton Springs and Drysdale is only a 20 minute drive to Geelong and just 10 minutes away from first class golf courses, wineries, the Portarlington-Melbourne Ferry and everything that the beautiful Bellarine Peninsula has to offer.","SOLD - $511,000","3
