collingwood-vic-3066,16 Waterloo Road Collingwood VIC 3066,"From brewery to brilliant.
The transition from the evocative industrial origins of the Yorkshire Brewery precinct to the residential brilliance of a city edge address is perfectly illustrated by this highly desirable dual level townhouse. A traditional period façade, instantly reflective of its Victorian era, creates an elegant introduction to superb spaces including a downstairs living and dining area framed by stylish timber floors and handsome ceiling beams. An open plan kitchen featuring marble benches, integrated storage, concealed fridge and Miele appliances makes a memorable contribution to these perfectly private dimensions while alluring accommodation defines the upper level. Two bedrooms and two bathrooms, including a main bedroom with walk in robes to a seductive ensuite, are irresistibly appealing. The downstairs powder room, excellent storage and secure garaging for two cars further complement inner city environs offering a gym, library and barbeque deck.","SOLD - $1,090,000","2

collingwood-vic-3066,34 Gold Street Collingwood VIC 3066,"Be Enticed by Something Different…
One of the more attractive attributes of Collingwood lies in its diversity and this home proves a wonderful alternative to your obligatory terrace which is the mainstay of the suburb’s somewhat eclectic & vibrant streetscape. Generous in its accommodation this contemporary gem (built 1982) is infinitely comfortable as is however time is near for an update to the kitchen & bathroom which are ‘tired’ and require reinvigoration. The home’s scope to improve, sublime location and uniqueness should without doubt excite the devoted inner city dweller…
Offering 2 sizeable bedrooms (Huge Master bedroom!), vast open plan lounge with parquetry floor, adjacent formal dining, functional but dated kitchen, split level bathroom/laundry, front & rear courtyards and vehicle access to a single carport from Easey Street. Whether your passion is the café culture, the multitude of fine eateries or simply being on the edge of Melbourne’s CBD this is lifestyle central… Enjoy!","SOLD - $1,079,500","2
