cockatoo-vic-3781,110 Mountain Road Cockatoo VIC 3781,"Kalimna - A Beautiful Place
A fully renovated 1890s Victorian weatherboard home originally from Surrey Hills re-imagined on a stunning 6 acre plus bush setting on the edge of Cockatoo & Gembrook.
The 4 bedroom home has 3 bathrooms and lovingly retains many original features such as the 11 ft ceilings, fretwork, high skirts, ornate cornicing, ceiling detail and roses. State of the art double-glazed windows and doors through-out resonate with the character of the original.
The master bedroom with French doors on to the large Merbau deck keeps the original feature fireplace and continues through a his and hers robe into the luxe ensuite with large bath, walk-in shower and pedestal basin. The crisp sophisticated provincial style of the bathroom, the French pattern travertine flooring, the offset square tiles and light fittings are echoed in the second ensuite and main bathroom/laundry.
The guest suite has floor to ceiling cabinetry and tv recess. Accessed externally from the rear deck into the washroom, wc and shower space. Perfect for teenager, extended family or guests. The second bedroom is oversized and has a beautiful outlook onto the established garden bed beyond the double sash windows. At 4m x 4m this bedroom can easily accommodate 2 children or provide a second living zone if required.
All bedrooms are joined by a wide corridor with beautiful original fretwork that leads to the open plan living zone with feature oak herringbone flooring and coffered ceiling detail. A panoramic wood-fire sits on a large inset bluestone slab and pumps the heat into this sophisticated yet homely space.
A bespoke classic English galley kitchen lines the entirety of one wall and extends into the pantry with study nook. Painted deep blue cabinetry compliments the warmth of the oak flooring with double butlers sink, Miele dishwasher & dual fuel 1100mm Belling Richmond range cooker. Cook while wistfully taking in the bush setting viewed through the double glazed windows. Then join family or friends on the large deck to enjoy the sun setting through the trees.
A retained driveway brings you right to the impressive front entrance with deck and wrap around veranda. There is no shortage of parking for vehicles here or around the 10m x 8.3m American style barn. The beauty of the property can be glimpsed through the cypress tree-lined driveway as you approach from the Cockatoo to Gembrook cut-through that is the much loved Mountain Road with its stunning views towards Warburton Ranges & back towards Emerald.
A true lifestyle property to call home forever more.","SOLD - $999,000","4

cockatoo-vic-3781,450 Woori Yallock Road Cockatoo VIC 3781,"Cockatoo Estate
Luxe country farmhouse on 23.5 clear useable acres divided into 7 easy-to-work paddocks with quality electric fencing (as can be attested to by our mildly shocked photographer), stock yard, spring fed dam & 2 large machinery sheds. The perfect set up for your equine retreat or hobby farm.
The scene is set as you turn off the main road, through the gates and onto the remarkable Canadian Flame Tree lined driveway flanked by the two large front paddocks used for cutting hay annually yielding 70 rounds plus.
The property currently accommodates 8 head of cattle, 3 horses and 20 plus sheep with the recent addition of a dozen lambs.
Rarely have I seen such a beautiful acreage property so well set up and ready for the next lucky owners to hit the ground running. There is even a healthy crop of asparagus that typically takes 3 years to establish. The honest, robust yet luxuriously appointed 4 bedroom rendered brick home has a flexible floor plan. The hotel style kitchenette in the 2nd living space with cosy wood-fire and separate entrance through French-doors works as a parents retreat, Airbnb, accommodation for guests or a dual occupancy situation.
Tasmanian oak floors connect this space to the further 3 bedrooms and large main bathroom with impressive standalone bath, a whole wall of storage opposite the European laundry corridors straight into the sizeable mudroom.
For me, the pièce de résistance is the super stylish kitchen with soft-close cabinetry, Caesarstone bench-tops and quality stainless steel appliances looking out to the paddocks and livestock beyond. Prep your home-grown veggies and cook conventionally or stew on the slow combustion stove.
Love it. Buy It. Live it.
