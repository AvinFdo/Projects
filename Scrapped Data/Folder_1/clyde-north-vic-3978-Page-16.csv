clyde-north-vic-3978,31 Murphy Street Clyde North VIC 3978,"Generous Space With Victorian Grace.
There are not many homes that will compare on quality and charm than the ex-display of award-winning builder Smart homes. Ready to move in and call home now, the floor plan offers versatility with old world charm, blended with the modern expectations of today. A combination of living areas includes formal lounge or sitting room, spacious family room bathed in natural light and easy access to stunning conservatory, a beautiful space lined with plants and ideal place to sit in the winter months and enjoy our Melbourne weather. My favourite living space is the skylight lined loft that can be used for an array of purposes including theatre room or rumpus room. The kitchen is the heart of the home, its surfaces lined in white stone, walk in pantry, 900mm oven and cook top. The Laila features a dormer window, fretwork arches & skillion veranda, the timber panelling on the walls and ceiling makes this home stand out from a crowd. Every time I walk through this home, I fall in love with it a little more and I hope it buyer feels the same.","SOLD - $671,500","3
