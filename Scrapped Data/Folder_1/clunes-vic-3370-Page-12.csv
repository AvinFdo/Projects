clunes-vic-3370,3567 Ballarat - Maryborough Road CLUNES VIC 3370,"Almost 35 acress of Grazing on Three Titles
Ideally located just a stones throw from the Township of Clunes, this picturesque farmlet offers everything you will need to be self sufficient off the land. With spectacular scattered mature gums throughout this property has previously been planted to oats, though is now grass. The enormous dam has never been known to go dry, and is fed by a seasonal creek so refills very quickly each season. Many surrounding properties have access to bore water, so there is a good chance of being able to sink a bore if you would like to irrigate.
A comfortable double brick home is ready to move straight into, and offers three bedrooms all with built in robes, and the master has two way access to the large family bathroom. The north facing family room bathes in sun most of the day while presenting a wonderful floor to ceiling local stone fire surround as well as a split system, and opens onto the dining area spacious enough for the largest of dining tables. The country style kitchen has both electric cooking and a combustion stove for any chef to cook delicious meals in!
Also under roof is a double lock up garage, and separately the property offers a hay shed & large shed with concrete floor and power which has a cool room for meat, jams and pickles, or maybe tools? Attached to this is a chook shed with a door out to the orchard, containing plum, pear, apple and apricot trees.
If you are a keen bird lover, there is a large bank of aviaries, previously used to keep pheasant and peacocks in, though these could easily be converted into dog pens. A further shed houses a bay for milking, a pig pen and a smoke house. To finish the package, raised vegetable gardens to season all the delights to grow on the farm!
A comfortable home on a productive, well fenced property, or you may choose to purchase and build on one of the other titles? STCA of course. Sealed bitumen frontage on two sides for ease of access and convenience of town water.
Inspect today as this is truly a lovely parcel of land and needs to be seen to be truly appreciated.
