A uniquely private island hideaway less than two hours from Melbourne and light years from the stresses of city life, experience the rural charm and quiet isolation that is Beauciel. Maintained as a working farm with an organic fruit and vegetable garden and capacity to run sheep and cattle, no expense has been spared in creating this idyllic French Island retreat set on 50 acres (approx). Boasting sweeping views of Western Port Bay from one of the highest points on the island, the sprawling timber residence offers farmhouse-style luxury with four bedrooms, two bathrooms, a big country kitchen, slow-combustion pot belly stove and a huge living and dining area opening onto a north-facing deck. The master suite includes French doors onto a private deck, a walk-in robe and ensuite, while gleaming pacific beech timber floors feature throughout the extensively renovated and extended home. A walled garden made from rustic corrugated iron and reclaimed century-old pier timbers providing a sheltered environment for espaliered apples, peaches and other fruits together with vegetables and ornamental vines all organically grown and watered by a drip system fed from a bore. Large rainwater storage tanks and a sophisticated solar, wind and back-up diesel generator system add to the property's self-sufficiency, with much of the equipment housed in a cleverly restored chicory kiln. All the land has been has been recently fenced, new cattle yards constructed, dams excavated and pastures kept free of super phosphates and other fertilisers not conducive to organic farming. Get away from it all and enjoy total privacy, yet still be close to town with regular daily ferry and barge services.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"4
