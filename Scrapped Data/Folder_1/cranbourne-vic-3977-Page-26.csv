Ducted heating and a large split system air-conditioner provide additional year round comfort, whilst outside there's a double garage with remote door and internal access plus gated side access for those needing additional secure parking facilities.
Don't forget the massive backyard with an outstanding under-roofline alfresco that spans the entire width of the home. Boasting a full outdoor kitchen and pull down blinds that give it year round usability, this is the ideal place to relax with friends whilst the kids and pets run a muck in the private yard.
If you believe in the age old theory that a top location equals great real estate then this is an absolute must to inspect. Sensational position within walking distance to Rangebank Primary School and kindergarten. There's also easy access to buses, Merinda Park train station and Thompson Road, which provides direct access to all of the shopping facilities on offer at the Cranbourne Home Maker Centre!
With turnover in this ever popular estate at an all-time low don't muck around or else you will miss out!
