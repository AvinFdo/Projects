coronet-bay-vic-3984,8 Lorna Doone Drive Coronet Bay VIC 3984,"Beachside Budget Buying!
The Australian dream has always been to own a piece of Australia and call it home, closely followed by the quintessential beach-side holiday home which can be used for generations to come, then this classic home ticks all the boxes for a relaxed getaway at a very realistic price point.
Featuring an updated kitchen with huge caesarstone bench and quality appliances which overlooks the open living space with direct access to the wrap around verandah. The bathroom has also been brought into the 21st century with new vanity and shower, with both these prime cost items being recently improved all you need to do is invest in your own personal touches for your new beach retreat.
Positioned on 535m2 of easily maintained land, the property is a blank canvas outside with the added benefit of under-house access which can offer easy options to extend or create extra storage or living space if required. With fresh floor coverings and paint throughout, bring your furniture and settle in.
I have always had a rule that if i was to have a holiday house near the beach it would have to be close enough that i could walk back to grab another beer instead of relying on another Aussie icon, the esky and with 8 Lorna Doone Drive that certainly ticks that box with a comfortable 500m walk to the safe sandy swimming beach.
Coronet Bay is an ideal destination for those who enjoy fresh sea air, with access to a fantastic boat ramp for the fisher-people in the family as well as a general store which will cover all your immediate buying needs this hidden gem is on the verge of being discovered by those on the look out for affordable property in a relaxed environment.
Only 114km from Melbourne's CBD with Freeway basically the entire trip, this location is also only 35 minutes to the outer south eastern suburbs which allows easy access back to public transport if desired.
All in all a fantastic entry level opportunity with numerous options for habitation, from owner occupier or holiday retreat to a permanent or Airbandb styled lease, the choice is yours.","SOLD - $285,000","2
