clifton-hill-vic-3068,428 Wellington Street Clifton Hill VIC 3068,"Family-Sized Charmer - An Absolute Rarity!
An exceptional opportunity to acquire a highly-sought address in one of Clifton Hill's premier streets, this magnificent family home strikes a commanding presence that continues to impress, perfectly capturing the very essence of the area's rich heritage and culture.
No doubt, you will have noticed that genuine four bedroom, two bathroom homes in this pocket are a true rarity - so when one as charming as this presents itself, you had better be on your toes!
Showing off a timeless design throughout its extensively renovated interiors, affectionately brought up to speed with a long list of beautiful features and decor; whilst still paying tribute to its original charms and character.
Beautiful natural sandstone throughout the lower level and solid timber floorboards lining the upper, rear oversized garage and family practicality with an abundance of storage throughout.
Perfectly maximising the use of every space, the flow between living, dining and entertaining, with a cleverly configured floor-design that can easily adapt between four bedrooms, or three and an extra living zone - both of which are too often missing on the city edge.
Four double bedrooms, three on the upper level with robes and split system A/C's. The impressive master opening to a balcony, and luxurious family bathroom with spa. Downstairs, an extra-large fourth bedroom or lounge with room to add robes, and with it being alongside the laundry and 2nd bathroom, there's scope to incorporate ensuite-style access.
An impressive kitchen appointed with quality wall oven, 900mm gas cooktop and range hood, double-drawer dishwasher and excellent storage.
Airy, sunlit and very spacious living and dining with an ambient combustion wood heater and timber-framed doors opening outside to the lovely garden courtyard - the ultimate space for day-to-day living, unwinding and entertaining.
A range of city-edge rewards within walking distance: Darling and Edinburgh Gardens; Smith Street, Brunswick Street and Queens Parade's vibrant dining and cafe culture, prestigious schools, trams, trains and buses are all at your fingertips.
This fine residence is a rare commodity in every aspect and presents a seamless transition into a premium lifestyle. Most certainly worth stopping your day to inspect.
Potential rental return: $840-$900 per week.

clifton-hill-vic-3068,73 Roseneath Street Clifton Hill VIC 3068,"The Best Of Both Worlds
A classic single-fronted Victorian amidst a thriving urban sprawl, this timeless home is a remarkable example of when old world charm collides with modern inner-city convenience. From the front bullnose verandah; where you can sit and watch the world go by, to the 12 foot embellished ceilings and several open fireplaces, the home displays all the hallmarks of a refined era, with plenty of scope for contemporary enhancement. An inspired approach to renovation may produce exceptional results; enriching a spacious light-filled interior complete with two sizeable bedrooms, separate living and dining spaces, timber-lined kitchen and bathroom plus a European laundry. A rear sunroom spills out to a north facing courtyard - a private entertaining haven. Equipped with gas ducted heating and easy-care gardens, this eternal gem offers immediate comfort, just waiting to be polished and brought into a new era. Leafiness, immediate proximity to buses, Clifton Hill Train Station, cafes, Collingwood Leisure Centre, Darling Gardens, Yarra Bend Park, Merri Creek Trail and the Eastern freeway lead the location’s long list of advantages. Situated within 4km’s of the CBD and some of Melbourne’s finest schools and universities.","SOLD - $990,000","2
