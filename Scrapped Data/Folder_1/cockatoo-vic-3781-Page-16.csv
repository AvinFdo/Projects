cockatoo-vic-3781,15 Baker Street Cockatoo VIC 3781,"Treasured Retreat with Loads of Potential!
If you're looking for an escape from the hustle and bustle, it doesn't get much better than this three bedroom, two bathroom sanctuary nestled at the foot of a tranquil bushland reserve!
Topping the list of families, renovators, and developers alike, this treasured home set on a sprawling over approximately half of an acre of land instantly charms with hardwood floors and timber-lined walls, a spacious living with a fireplace, dedicated dining, classy kitchen featuring a stainless steel splashback, dual sink, and quality appliances (incl. a 900 mm gas cooktop), family zone, private study, three well-sized bedrooms (two with BIRs), two modern bathrooms (both with separate bath and shower), private toilet, and laundry.
An enormous front yard and a generous back garden present a potential hard to match, to build further accommodation whether as a bigger family home, holiday retreat, or even a charming B&B (STCA). Additional highlights include a front balcony, ramp access to the residence, ducted heating, main gas plumbing, and 2 x garages/storage sheds (1 double, 1 single) with bitumen driveway access.
Wonderfully located with easy access to Cockatoo Reserve, Wright Forest Bushland Reserve, and Cockatoo train station; it is also close to Cockatoo Primary School and Emerald Secondary College.","SOLD - $302,000","3
