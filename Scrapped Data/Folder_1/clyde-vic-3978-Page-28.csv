clyde-vic-3978,9 Jockey Lane Cranbourne VIC 3977,"Living Large on the Park
With 24 squares of living area, this near new, low maintenance townhouse, does not compromise on space.
As such, it would be an ideal first home, a home for a young family, or a downsize opportunity.
The townhouse is located in Cranbourne, within easy access to the South Gippsland Hwy/M1. It is situated within a very peaceful part of the suburb. There is a park directly in front of the residence, which would be ideal for residents who want to conveniently get out and unwind. However, it still has the convenience of being close to amenities such as the Amstel Club, Ranfurlie Golf Course, St Peter's College, childcare facilities and the Woolworths shopping precinct on the corner of Hall Rd & Evans Rd (due to open over the coming months).
The property boasts a unique 32m2 studio space above the garage. This space would suit a range of purposes including a fourth bedroom, dedicated work space, or retreat for teens or parents. Plumbing is already within the wall cavities of this space, meaning it could be converted into a fully self-contained area with a minimum of fuss or expense.
The town house is currently leased to an ideal tenant who has expressed the possibility of staying should an investor purchase. Also available with vacant possession.
Features include:
- 3 main bedrooms, master bedroom with full en-suite and walk in robe, bedrooms 2 & 3 with BIR's
- Huge 4th bedroom/studio or (possible teenagers retreat) above the double garage
