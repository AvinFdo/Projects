clifton-springs-vic-3222,14-16 Almerta Avenue Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"SPACE AND PRIVACY
Our young family has already started writing the chapter for their next life's journey and are very keen to get there. They are looking for someone who will enjoy this home as much as they have, and can't wait to show you what's on offer. We have had many requests for larger space, peace, quiet and privacy. This family home will tick your wish list.
In a quiet street in Clifton Springs a suburb on the Bellarine Peninsula is where the current family love the visibility to watch the children from the front and the back. A high fence keeps the kids and animals safe. Having been built in 1972 we know that they don't build them like this anymore. As they say in they say in the trade ""it has good bones"".
Large lounge room with a bay window seat, along with the added warmth of the wood heater in winter. One bathroom has been renovated and is now combined with the laundry. The shed could be tradie heaven, with another area nearby that could be become a man cave or extra accommodation for visitors. Thinking outside the square a fire pit has been placed in the top right hand corner of the block to make the most of the view. An outdoor shower for when you return from the beach or fishing. For me I would enjoy sitting under the Al Fresco area drinking coffee or wine listening to the trickle of the pond.
Enough about the outside, inside is a cosy place to be hanging out with family and friends. Time for you to come see for yourself. Let me show you what's behind the fence.","SOLD - $600,000","3
