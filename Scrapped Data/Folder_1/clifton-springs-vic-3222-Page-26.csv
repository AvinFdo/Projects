clifton-springs-vic-3222,24 Allara Court Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"What A Little Ripper!
Sometimes a property just grabs your attention and you simply just want to make it 'home' - this is that property!!
Don't be fooled by this property's understated facade as it is an exceptional prospect. A tree lined court location sets the theme for a lovely relaxed and tranquil setting for this fully renovated three bedroom home.
A fine light 'n' bright renovation is enhanced by a tilted roof line and various windows for lovely filtered light. The kitchen is modern and offers excellent storage solutions. The bathroom is a real head turner; complete with floor to ceiling tiles and crisp modern finishes. Ducted heating and split system air conditioning ensure you can make this property home from day one!
Boasting an approximate 18m frontage this property offers the high demand property feature of rear access for the cars, boat and a caravan. An impressive 10m x 7m (approximate) garage/shed simply wants for nothing; fully powered (including 15 amp power outlet), mezzanine storage, remote controlled roller door and glass sliding doors to rear offers a myriad of options for the incoming purchaser. The wide open spaces of a good old fashioned back yard provide further size and scope for the imagination to run wild.
Although it is difficult to just isolate one, my personal favourite feature of this home is a full equipped and expansive decked entertaining area; complete with main's gas connection for the BBQ, downlights, exhaust fan and a sheltered area for early coffee or a late wine.
A court location with the added advantage of a pedestrian lane way to Jetty Road places you only short stroll to the Clifton Springs Primary School and the Jetty Road Reserve. For the boating enthusiast the property is perfectly positioned with the Clifton Springs Boast Ramp literally just down the road.
A wonderful home for today and a great investment for the future.","SOLD - $400,000","3

The Facts (In Short):
-Undoubtedly one of the best entry level buying opportunities in today's property market
-Neat as a pin 3 bedroom home right in the heart of the Clifton Springs Golf Club Precinct
-Corner allotment; 628m2 (approximately) land holding; x2 drive way cross overs
-Expansive decked entertaining/alfresco zone
The Features:
My guess it will be standing room only when we take this 'gem' to the open market - it represents what I would consider one of the best entry level buying opportunities for 2017. Perfectly positioned a short stroll from the Clifton Springs Golf Club and with the well renowned Clifton Springs Boat Ramp literally just down the road gives this property a perfect AAA location rating.
The property itself is a ripper and is as neat as a pin! A lovely orientation ensures this property is bathed in an abundance of natural light. 3 bedrooms all have built in robes. A generous L-shaped lounge/dining boasts big windows providing a lovely connection 'inside to out'. The expansive decked entertaining zone spans 8.1m x 3.9m (approximately) and is exceptional; it provides a lovely sheltered area for entertaining your guests and from its elevated position captures lovely cool summer breezes. A substantial land holding of approximately 628m, a corner allotment with dual driveway crossovers and secure x2 carport with roller door gives the incoming purchaser a pleather of options only limited to their imagination. The modern comforts of ducted heating, wall mounted air conditioner and ceiling fans ensures this property ticks all the boxes.","SOLD - $400,000","3
