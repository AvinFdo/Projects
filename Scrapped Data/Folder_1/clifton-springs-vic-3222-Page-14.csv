clifton-springs-vic-3222,8 Almerta Avenue Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"SOMETHING DIFFERENT
Have you been looking around and finding that the homes you are seeing are all the same? Well this one breaks that mould. This split level home has character and views from a mezzanine level. In a quiet street of Clifton Springs this family home is designed to entertain inside and out. The kitchen invites you to sit and chat at the bench allowing everyone to interact and enjoy time together. The Mezzanine level opens onto a deck where the views across Corio Bay change daily. You can watch the ships, yachts, fishermen and the fireworks or just relax. Lead light adds colour to doors and highlights. Recently refurbished bathroom is bright and light. The hot weather over summer is controlled by two air conditioners with air circulated with ceiling fans. The ambience in winter is tangible with a gas log fire. The vendors tell me the home is so toasty in winter they only need short sleeves. But wait there's more. When buying a home generally they get their ticks from the kitchen and the shed. Well here we have a near new kitchen and a fantastic Man Cave. Clifton Springs is fast becoming a suburb known for supplying all the amenities you need to work, rest and play. There are excellent schools to choose from. Options for shopping include a range of supermarkets and complexes. Medical Centres, sporting groups, restaurants, wineries, walking tracks. I have enjoyed the lifestyle here for over thirty years. It's time to share it. If you are unable to attend the open for inspection private inspections are welcome.","SOLD - $550,000","3

The chance to build your dream home in a premier location rarely comes about. Here, at 29 Narawi Avenue Clifton Springs you have that opportunity. Blocks of land with a generous size of 681m2 and a 20m frontage are hard to find and allows the prospect of designing a spacious family home. With breathtaking views across Corio Bay, the Westerly aspect affords a panoramic outlook from Geelong, around to the You Yangs and beyond towards Melbourne. The gradient of the land is sloping and it would be unrealistic to be built out. This view will remain protected for generations to come. After you've built your forever home, you'll be the envy of family and friends whenever they come to visit. Clifton Springs and Drysdale is only a 20 minute drive to Geelong and just 10 minutes from first-class golf courses, wineries, the Portarlington-Melbourne Ferry and everything that the beautiful Bellarine Peninsula has to offer. Or you might be just as content, sitting on a balcony, enjoying the view. Call today for more information. Titled land doesn't last long.","SOLD - $340,000",681m²,Vacant land,Sold by private treaty 11 Apr 2019,"29 Narawi Avenue, Clifton Springs VIC 3222 was last sold in 2019.","ALL

clifton-springs-vic-3222,7 Achilpa Avenue Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"Cathedral ceiling. Renovated. Yes!
Whether you're looking for a weekender, family home or an investment property, there is so much on offer here at 7 Achilpa Ave.
On the ground level, a large lounge provides a great breakout space when there's a conflict over who's watching what on TV, or plenty of room for a number of bunk beds if the kids want to bring some friends down for the weekend. A bedroom with BIR on this level provides great separation from the other two bedrooms upstairs, where you'll also enjoy a great study nook, central bathroom and separate toilet. Duck through the laundry and you'll find a massive alfresco and spa, perfect for both parties and Sunday BBQs.
A magnificent cathedral ceiling leads you upstairs again to the updated kitchen, dining and living. Providing the perfect vantage point looking back to the living and huge balcony, the kitchen boasts 40mm stone benchtops with waterfall edge, vinyl wrap cabinetry, stainless steel appliances and loads of storage.
A Jindara wood heater will provide warmth in the approaching cooler months, while split systems in the upstairs living and main bedroom manage the rest.
Side gated access means you can finally keep the boat or van at home, while keeping your car locked away in the garage.
Fishos will love being just moments from the ramp, and golfers spoilt for choice with Clifton Springs and Curlewis courses nearby. Clifton Springs Primary is within walking distance, and you can choose between the new Bayview Central or High St. shops. Awesome.
Enquire now and you could be calling 7 Achilpa Ave yours in no time.","SOLD - $459,000","3
