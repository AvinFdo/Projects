clifton-hill-vic-3068,189 Queens Parade Clifton Hill VIC 3068,"COMMERCIAL ZONE 1
This Clifton Hill landmark is a part of Melbourne's cultural heritage. Built in the 1880s by the Kimpton flour milling family, the residence has been home since the 1960s to the late Mars McMillan, who with Alastair McAllister founded Harpsichords of Melbourne. The property was both home and workplace for the renowned and much-loved instrument builder and Australian Rules fanatic, who died in 2016. In the heart of the Queens Parade commercial, cafe and shopping precinct, it is set well back from the street on a deep garden block with right-of-way access, just around the corner from the Darling Gardens. Distinguished by magnificently proportioned rooms and soaring ceilings, this substantial residence, in need of extensive restoration, comprises elegant sitting and dining rooms opening from a grand arched hallway, vast balcony bedroom and two further bedrooms, kitchen/meals area and bathroom/laundry. Here is a once-in-a-decade opportunity to create a splendid family residence or spacious commercial/professional premises in a thriving centre just 10 minutes by tram from the CBD.","SOLD - $1,330,000","3

clifton-hill-vic-3068,428 Wellington Street Clifton Hill VIC 3068,"Family-Sized Charmer - An Absolute Rarity!
An exceptional opportunity to acquire a highly-sought address in one of Clifton Hill's premier streets, this magnificent family home strikes a commanding presence that continues to impress, perfectly capturing the very essence of the area's rich heritage and culture.
No doubt, you will have noticed that genuine four bedroom, two bathroom homes in this pocket are a true rarity - so when one as charming as this presents itself, you had better be on your toes!
Showing off a timeless design throughout its extensively renovated interiors, affectionately brought up to speed with a long list of beautiful features and decor; whilst still paying tribute to its original charms and character.
Beautiful natural sandstone throughout the lower level and solid timber floorboards lining the upper, rear oversized garage and family practicality with an abundance of storage throughout.
Perfectly maximising the use of every space, the flow between living, dining and entertaining, with a cleverly configured floor-design that can easily adapt between four bedrooms, or three and an extra living zone - both of which are too often missing on the city edge.
Four double bedrooms, three on the upper level with robes and split system A/C's. The impressive master opening to a balcony, and luxurious family bathroom with spa. Downstairs, an extra-large fourth bedroom or lounge with room to add robes, and with it being alongside the laundry and 2nd bathroom, there's scope to incorporate ensuite-style access.
An impressive kitchen appointed with quality wall oven, 900mm gas cooktop and range hood, double-drawer dishwasher and excellent storage.
Airy, sunlit and very spacious living and dining with an ambient combustion wood heater and timber-framed doors opening outside to the lovely garden courtyard - the ultimate space for day-to-day living, unwinding and entertaining.
A range of city-edge rewards within walking distance: Darling and Edinburgh Gardens; Smith Street, Brunswick Street and Queens Parade's vibrant dining and cafe culture, prestigious schools, trams, trains and buses are all at your fingertips.
This fine residence is a rare commodity in every aspect and presents a seamless transition into a premium lifestyle. Most certainly worth stopping your day to inspect.
Potential rental return: $840-$900 per week.
