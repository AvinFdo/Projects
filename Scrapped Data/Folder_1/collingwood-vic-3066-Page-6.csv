collingwood-vic-3066,602/28 Stanley Street Collingwood VIC 3066,"UNDER OFFER
Offering everything one expects from a 3 bedroom luxury home - secure side by side car parking for 2 cars with attached storage, security coded entry foyer and coded passenger lift to the penthouse lobby but lets cut straight to the good stuff. The views are OUTSTANDING. They encompass the CBD, Northern Ranges, Dandenong Ranges to back over Richmond. Youll be so busy admiring the vista laid out before you, you will need to tear your eyes away to actually inspect the three bedrooms each with robes, the master bedroom with ensuite, walk in robe and private balcony plus the two additional bathrooms.
While your attention is diverted from the eye-popping-head-on-a-swivel stick views yes theres more indoors to admire - the expansive living, meals and kitchen - Wow this is amazing! Gas fireplace, oak floors, chandelier, double wine fridge, storage lots of storage. Plus the luxury kitchen has all the inclusions one would expect. A nod to the areas heritage is on show with exposed concrete ceilings and brick walls. Zoned to each room air conditioning, double glazed/tinted glass, video/intercom to the front door. Gosh Ill need to sit down to absorb all this.
Lets get back to those views - panoramic north facing views from every window to the City, King Lake Ranges, Dandenong Ranges, South/East Melbourne. If the views from inside your windows simply arent enough, then bring the outdoors in or simply extend the entertaining thru the fully opening stacker doors on to the full width north facing balcony sheltered by fully automated awnings.
Above all is the incredible convenience of a superb location all in a smaller boutique building, just a very short walk ( 100m) to Smith St for food, shopping and tram, I could go on and on, but really a personal inspection would be best to appreciate how good this is.","SOLD - $1,680,000","3
