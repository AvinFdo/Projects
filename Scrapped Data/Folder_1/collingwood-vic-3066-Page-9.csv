Vast stone waterfall benches combine with Bosch appliances, under-mount sinks and mirrored splashbacks to present a sleek and sophisticated kitchen that overlooks open-plan living with a relaxed flow to the home's undercover balcony.
Meanwhile, the upstairs offers even further sense of retreat where both bedrooms share easy access to the bathroom and an open alcove study, whilst sharing a direct connection to another private balcony.
Additional features in this sophisticated designer residence include secure video entry, basement parking with a storage cage and elevator access, as well as reverse cycle heating / cooling.
Smith St is one of inner-Melbourne's most iconic and authentic strips of cafes, restaurants, bars and shops and its all just metres away, whilst the CBD and plenty of public transport are also within easy reach.
