clunes-vic-3370,383 Clunes Road Creswick VIC 3363,"Prized Acreage on Outskirts of Creswick
This ideal slice of land provides all the comfort of country living yet offers the nearby convenience of the buzzing township of Creswick. An ideal hobby farm, or the perfect building site, this well fenced 10 acres of land is just waiting for those wishing build, farm or just invest. With power to a pole near the proposed building site and a planning permit in place, this private setting offers a water bore, small shed and a back drop of scattered trees to tempt the tastebuds. Separated into two well fenced paddocks, one is cleared and the other with light to medium tree coverage with a lovely clearing for the proposed home site - which is close to the shed, bore (unlimited) and kids play area. This is not quite finished, but wouldn't take much to get it up and going! With access to unlimited water (which is not something you can pay to set up any more), the world is your oyster. Irrigate if you choose to improve your pasture, water your stock without concern, or even hook it up to the house if you prefer.
This generous allotment is ideal for a new build, with many other new neighbouring properties taking advantage of its position and commuting simplicity. Located just 20 minutes north of Ballarat in the Shire of Hepburn, this land is definitely a tantalising opportunity for farmers to downsize or ideal for a much needed tree change. If you are looking for a little land for those much loved pets, then this property is definitely worth a drive by. Come on, make your next move, call our agents today, to find out further details and conditions of this great buy.","SOLD - $187,000",4.05ha,Vacant land,Sold by private treaty 9 May 2016,"383 Clunes Road, Creswick VIC 3363 was last sold in 2016.",0,https://www.domain.com.au/383-clunes-road-creswick-vic-3363-2012019222,"Neighbourhood Insights

clunes-vic-3370,23 Phillip Street Creswick VIC 3363,"One of the Best in Creswick
There is always something truly warm about a sandstone home, whether it is the creamy tones or the texture of the brick; it seems like a solid beach with waves embedded in its structure. Top this homely construction with a colorbond roof, a decorative veranda and place it on a corner allotment of 2539m2 and you have a home with warmth, character and room to move. Movement is what this home is all about. Not only does this package offer space inside, it also begins with a three bay garage for the family vehicles and an additional double garage for further machinery or boy's toys. Entertaining outdoors will definitely not be inhibited, as there is an extensive paved alfresco zone that ensures your dining experience is well protected. Oh and did I mention a salt chlorinated in-ground swimming pool? Imagine those summer evenings around it or even during the cooler weather as it is heated via passive solar from the roof.
Take a walk inside and cast your eye over the liberal floorplan: four bedrooms include an oversized master with luxury ensuite and walk in robe, whilst the three minor bedrooms are complimented by a further study or fifth bedroom, family bathroom with spa and a convenient laundry. A large meals area encased in a sunlit bay window contributes to the living space, which blends perfectly with the open plan kitchen and casual living zone. With stainless steel appliances and a full four person breakfast bar and large walk in pantry, this area is a welcoming hub to an already warm and cosy home. The formal lounge offers a mantled 2 way combustion fire plus ducted central heating for further warmth and convenience and is designed to offer a formal dining area for those more significant dinner parties. The polished timber floors in the family area and games room have been trimmed with detailed etchings that create an interesting and designated zone for family and friends. Three split systems also provide additional temperature control in these entertaining areas as well.
When you're looking for a home that has the ability to entertain family and friends with real style, then this stunning 36 square home has been crafted with that in mind. Situated opposite bushland and offering a uniquely private and country style setting this property is without doubt one of Creswick's finest family homes.
