De La Haye Park is the perfect island lifestyle farming property, suitable for cattle, sheep, horses or a multitude of other opportunities, with enough space to accommodate multiple families and only 10 km from the French Island passenger ferry jetty.
If you are ready for a sea-change/tree-change, come to unique French Island for a look around and let your future thrive.
French Island is approximately two thirds national park and is unincorporated, therefore is not governed by a local council, so no council rates apply. Being off the grid, means there are no power companies to deal with and no water rates to pay. About an hour from Melbourne, but like stepping back in time, we are a small community of around 100 residents, accessible by passenger ferry from Stony Point, or vehicle barge from Corinella.

coronet-bay-vic-3984,French Island VIC 3921,"The Horseshoe Homestead - your next project?
Originally built at the beginning of last century, the former De La Haye farm house along Coast Road just north of Tankerton on French Island has been abandoned since the early 1970's but its' foot thick concrete, daub and timber walls are still standing, defying the elements and hoping that one day someone, possibly inspired by television programs such as Restoration Home and Country House Rescue, will come along and resuscitate what is left of the whimsically named ""Horseshoe Homestead"" presumably after the shape of the original building.
Consisting of three main rooms to front with a fire place and chimney at one end and a double internal brick fire place between the other two main rooms inside, the still partially roofed building boasts several dormer windows in the roofline, a unique architectural feature for the time, which still lets filtered light into the roof space with its original timber pole rafters.
The back of the building has collapsed but there is still plenty to indicate the wealth that was once generated by the industrious rural production of the property in years gone by such as the well about 10 meters from the house and the remains of a Chicory Kiln on a nearby property.
A welcoming stand of mature deciduous trees with their carpet of jonquils surround the house and presents an image of solid permanency from the front gate; but the house is not the only desirable feature. The property is an elevated 120 Acres close to the coast, well fenced and divided into 4 paddocks with a good sized dam in each. There are half a dozen stands of mature shelter trees, a 4 bay machine shed and another smaller shed for storage. Currently used by a neighbouring farmer for grazing purposes, the arrangement works well, as the grass is kept down and the cows are happy. As this a farming property there is no GST on the sale.
Live the lifestyle of the weekend farmer at an affordable price. Contact Phil Bock our resident French Island representative on 0438 497 715. Phil will meet you at the ferry and take you directly to the property which is only 9 kms away.","SOLD - $390,000","−
