clayton-south-vic-3169,24 Kitson Road Clayton South VIC 3169,"IDEAL FIRST HOME OR INVESTMENT WITH GREAT POTENTIAL
On 579m² approximately in a great position backing onto Clayton South Primary School, this largely original home has been kept in pristine condition throughout its life and offers many potential options for its new owner. Firstly, being it the condition it is investors could simply rent it out with ease; it could also be renovated to add further value or you may explore its potential for dual occupancy or redevelopment (STCA). With its classic orange brick facade giving it timeless appeal, the home features a generous lounge/dining room with a heater and there's also a timber kitchen with upright oven/stove and an included meals area. There are 3 bedrooms that all feature built in wardrobes plus a neat family bathroom, separate toilet and a full laundry. Outside you find a covered patio spanning the back of the home plus a separate steel garage and big backyard that shows its obvious potential. And with Clarinda Shopping Centre, buses and the facilities of central Clayton all just minutes away, this is a home with truly broad appeal.","SOLD - $800,000","3
