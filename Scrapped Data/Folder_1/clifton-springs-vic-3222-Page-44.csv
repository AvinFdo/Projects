In amongst this suburb of Clifton Springs are hidden gems. This block of land is one of them. In an established area of Clifton Springs you could build the home of your dreams. Just imagine having your kitchen upstairs and every morning looking out the window to a different view. Possible here in this location. Imagine having an entertainment area upstairs and enjoying the company of family and friends looking at the bay watching the ships pass by while you enjoy a coffee or a wine. Very possible here.
The sight does need some clearing before the works can begin but it will all be worth it. Fishermen will like being close to the boat ramp and golfers would enjoy being close to the golf course. Clifton Springs is a suburb still coming into its own. Why not come for a drive and explore your next living location?","SOLD - $182,500",585m²,Vacant land,Sold by private treaty 1 Apr 2016,"32 Yarramundi Drive, Clifton Springs VIC 3222 was last sold in 2016.","ALL
