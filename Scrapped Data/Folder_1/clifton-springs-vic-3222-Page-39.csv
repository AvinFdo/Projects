clifton-springs-vic-3222,77 Bayshore Avenue Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"Big bay views and big potential!
The big bay views are breathtaking from Bayshore Avenue and this elevated 3-bedroom home is no exception! Boasting clear views of the You Yangs and turquoise waters of Port Phillip Bay, this home’s sweeping panorama includes the tranquil treed Golf Course to the east and and gorgeous lights of Geelong to the west. Comfortably livable as is, this solid build and large block scream ‘project’. Given the views and space, the results would be impressive (STCA)!
A northern balcony spans the facade bring you closer to the vista. Sunsets are stunning and comfortably enjoyed from the fully-enclosed western end of the balcony. The kitchen/meals/living room, separate lounge and master bedroom are spoilt with the scenic northern aspect.
The kitchen offers cooktop, wall oven and grill. An air conditioner and electric heater assist comfort. The lounge flows to the enclosed balcony increasing the footprint for entertaining. The master bedroom, with en suite access to the 2-way bathroom, flows from the lounge.
The minor bedrooms and laundry bud off a sunny landing with rear patio access. The landing, with split system, makes an ideal play space or study.
The living level is perched on top of a triple garage and workshop, ideal for tradies or those with ‘toys’. Ample off-street parking. At the rear, the patio is fenced and private. Beyond, the large yard is a blank canvas.
Use your imagination here, or simply enjoy the key asset - the view!","SOLD - $466,000","3

clifton-springs-vic-3222,3 Takanna Avenue Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"Spacious home with views and potential
Deceptively spacious, this 4-bedroom home sits on the high side of the avenue capitalising on westerly bay views and spectacular sunsets.
Set on 720sqm approx, this blissfully private home has the scope for renovation or development (STCA) and is convenient to bay beaches, the boat ramp and the golf course.
On entry, the open plan, generous proportions and cathedral ceilings have instant appeal. Scenic bay windows in the lounge and master bedroom capture lovely views over the front veranda and across the bay. They also harness the afternoon sun and vibrant sunset tones.
The sunken lounge is particularly spacious providing ample room to spread out and unwind. Further in, open plan living incorporates kitchen and meals, flowing to a rear deck and undercover outdoor entertaining patio.
The storage-laden kitchen features a 900mm Nightingale electric/gas cooker and dishwasher. A powerful Heatcharm wood burner and large skylight boost the ambiance in this airy space.
The parent’s and children's domains are entirely separate. Masters enjoy peace and quiet at the facade with walk-in robe and en suite shower room.
The children’s wing is impressive with a luxury bathroom, featuring large corner spa, shower and vanity, separate toilet and 3 queen-sized bedrooms with built-in robes.
Ducted heating and ceiling fans throughout ensure comfort year round.
The sunny yard is a safe haven for children and pets. There is a single garage and side access provides space to house the caravan or boat securely.
An ideal first family-sized home with space and great potential.
Property currently tenanted until December 2016.","SOLD - $370,000","4
