DEADLINE PRIVATE SALE CLOSING MONDAY 25 MAY AT 5.00 (Unless Sold Prior)
* Register to attend an open for inspection*
In order to maintain a maximum of 10 attendees to all Open Inspections, we ask that you please register to attend. By registering your details, you avoid disappointment if more than 10 people attend the inspection and will assist us in keeping the inspections as safe as possible for our team and our clients.
Quiet, secure and wonderfully located, this single-storey two-bedroom Fairfield home offers first-home buyers prime entry into inner-suburban life.
Positioned at the back of a boutique block with just three dwellings, and within walking distance of Fairfields best assets from backstreet cafes and thriving Fairfield village, to an abundant transport network of busses and trains (plus a short drive from the Eastern Freeway) its location is just as beguiling as the refreshingly modern interior behind its traditional red-brick facade.
Welcoming you upon entry is an exceptionally large living room, with plenty of room to create your own comfortable lounge retreat with additions like an entry table, bookshelf and/or buffet hutch.
Then you have the option to diverge one of two ways: to the light and bright kitchen and dining area, with dishwasher, wall oven and griller, looking out to a spacious and low-maintenance courtyard, or to a hallway that leads to the bathroom and two bedrooms (one with built-in robe), each with lush garden views.
Other coveted features include laundry with courtyard access, ducting heating, split system, and combined garage and carport that offers two secure parking spaces.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"2
