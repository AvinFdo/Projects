clifton-hill-vic-3068,49 Dally Street Clifton Hill VIC 3068,"Exceptional Assets
$620,000 - $670,000
Compact, carefree and stylish - the epitome of historic Clifton Hill - and perfectly adapted to today's lifestyles. Now into its second century but showing no sign of ageing, this 3 bedroom single fronted brick cottage has been superbly transformed by a hidden second storey addition.
Behind a picket fence, the home includes hallmark glass leadlights, timber fretwork, high ceilings and polished Baltic pine floorboards. Of the 3 well proportioned bedrooms, the upstairs rear bedroom must be the favourite with its cathedral ceiling and full of light from ample windows. It is above the bright and charming open plan kitchen-living room which features timber cupboards and stainless steel appliances. Its double doors open to a delightful compact courtyard - think of an outdoor room designed for winter sun and summer shade - with sheltered decks around a garden (with a rainwater tank). Also features outstanding period style bathroom with claw foot bath and separate powder room, useful storage, gas ducted heating and gate access to the rear ROW.
In one of this coveted neighbourhood's quietest streets, this inner urban home is close all public transport, Yarra Bend parkland, Abbotsford Convent Arts precinct, Collingwood Childrens Farm and fresh food market as well as the delights of Clifton Hill, Northcote, Fitzroy and Carlton shopping and entertainment precincts.
* Charming Federation era brick cottage
* Delightfully updated and extended
* 3 spacious bedrooms (1 upstairs)
* Excellent quality fittings and finishes
