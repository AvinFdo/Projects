clayton-south-vic-3169,37 Orloff Close Clayton South VIC 3169,"Upsize Your Family!
Wanting to escape your crammed situation? Upsize and watch your family grow up in this beautiful single-level, four-bedroom defined by its abundance of space and the versatility of multiple living areas in a location close to Heatherton Park, schools, public transport and Springvale and Clayton Central shopping centres.
Polished timber floors spread to a striking effect in the lounge room, which is kept warm by a heater and relaxation is destined to take place here. The luxury of having a second living area also means the kids and adults can easily separate into their own retreats when the need for some solitude is required!
When its time for the family to come together, a communal open-plan living/dining area marries with a large timber kitchen where a Miele dishwasher, a gas cooktop, wall oven and a huge amount of storage will leave the cook of the house truly satisfied.
Accommodation consists of three spacious bedrooms with built-in robes (Master with ensuite), while a large spa bath in the main family bathroom adds a touch of luxury.
Substantial storage, ducted heating, air-conditioning, separate laundry with a second toilet, single garage plus carport and an easy-care backyard ensures a low maintenance, hassle-free lifestyle, which you and your family deserve.
