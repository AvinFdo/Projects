cranbourne-vic-3977,9 South Anderson Court Cranbourne VIC 3977,"**UNDER OFFER / UNDER CONTRACT**
RANGEBANK ESTATE: If you believe in the age old theory that a top location equals great real estate then this is an absolute must to inspect. Sensational position within walking distance to Rangebank Primary School and Kindergarten with Lawson Pool Recreation Reserve literally across the road! Within close proximity to Merinda Park train station and Thompson Road, direct to all of the shopping facilities on offer at Marriott Waters and the Cranbourne Home Maker Centre!

The central kitchen is complete with ample cupboard/bench space, a 4-burner hot plate plus a wall oven. All of this and a whole lot more overlooking the tiled family/meals zone with convenient external sliding door access.
Upon entry you will be greeted by a spacious family area with ceiling fan, S/S air-conditioning and gas heating. Outdoor entertaining is taken care of with the oversized paved pergola with downlights and brush wire fencing, which further increases the privacy levels. This is the perfect place for entertaining with family and friends during the warmer months!
