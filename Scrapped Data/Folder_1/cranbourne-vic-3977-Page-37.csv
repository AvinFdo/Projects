cranbourne-vic-3977,54-56 Cherryhills Drive Cranbourne VIC 3977,"AUCTION THIS SATURDAY
Home to the Cranbourne Race Track, Casey RACE, Cranbourne Park Shopping Centre, the Homemaker Centre. Complete with a great range of primary and secondary schools both public and private. Driving distance to some of Casey's best shopping malls including Fountain Gate and Casey Central - you name it, Casey has got it! With 2 train stations nearby Cranbourne has grown into a bustling centre for those living in the South East corridor with easy access to highways and freeways that take you directly to Melbourne.
The property was purpose-built to entertain so if that's what you are looking to do, this is the one!
From the front of the property the first thing you see is the expansive wrap around decking and large front door, giving the home a feeling of class and style. Open the door and the magic starts to happen. The entranceway opens up to a feature staircase that leads to the master suite, but more on that later.
To the left the home opens up to an expansive lounge and day area designed to angle towards the stacked doors, which let home breathe and come alive on a summer's day. The entertainer's kitchen with granite bench tops contains all high-end appliances including Ilve oven and double-draw dishwasher. Cook up a storm while watching the kids play football in the backyard. And while you're at it, ask the barman to make you up an espresso martini in the built in bar!
The theatre room comes complete with its own bathroom, which also has access to outside, perfect if you want to drop a spa on the deck outside, ""hint hint"". The deck itself is huge. It overlooks the entire rear yard, and is complete with its own double shade sails for a little respite from the midday sun. There is a dedicated barbecue area for those summer barbecues too, complete with gas connection.
The home itself comprises four bedrooms and a study. The master suite comes complete with ensuite and hidden walk through wardrobes - oversized and highlighted with bench seats and the extra storage they provide. All four bedrooms are a great size with built in wardrobes. The study comes complete with its own built in cupboards and shelving.
In the winter months you may not want to spend the days on the deck, so you can use the formal lounge room, complete with its own gas feature fireplace. This house has it all.
We could go on forever, so we'll list some more of the highlights here:
- Evaporative cooling and ducted heating
- Double garage with internal access
- Separate shed or potential man cave adjacent to the garage
- Rear access for boats, trailers and trucks
- All on a sought after 1749m2 approx. block
View now to avoid disappointment. The kids will thank you!","SOLD - $875,000","5
