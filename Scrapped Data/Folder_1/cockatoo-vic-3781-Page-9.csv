cockatoo-vic-3781,3 Cockatoo Avenue Cockatoo VIC 3781,"Enchanted, Yet Edible Garden
**Due to strong market conditions, please note the Saturday 14th Open for Inspection has been CANCELLED.**
Bursting with character, magic, quirk and a tangible feel-good vibe this home promises to nourish your soul and your belly. Super close to Cockatoo Main Street and the Primary School on a sealed road, this 2 level home has the comfort & function you seek.
The front garden is bursting with fairy-tale colour – fuchsias, begonias, dahlias, salvias, sedums, feature trees, rock walls, pathways & bog garden.
The rear garden is like-wise packed with established vegetable patches currently yielding potatoes, amaranth, beans, raspberries, fruit trees, lavender & herbs all growing in abundance.
The front porch is the perfect spot to reap the rewards of a weekend tending the gardens. Under the house there is enough room to build a workshop for all your gardening needs - along with the single shed at the rear of the property.
Inside, you enter the main living room with meals and a quaint country kitchen with large walk-in pantry. There is one bedroom on this level with main bathroom, separate toilet and laundry/mudroom.
Up the stairs you will find 3 further bedrooms. I can imagine being a child and simply falling in love with the 4th smaller Garrett-like bedroom snuggled up with a book and listening to the rain on the tin roof, safe and warm.
All services, concrete stumps & ready for sale.
If getting back to basics and becoming part of a thriving local community is what you want - then this is the home for you.

cockatoo-vic-3781,21 Maurice Street Cockatoo VIC 3781,"Room With A View To Your Future
What absolute bliss to sit on the rear deck of this elevated weatherboard home on 2000m2 approx. drinking tea in the morning sunshine. This simple, feel good home faces east towards Gembrook. Its proximity to Paternoster Road serves as a quick getaway to Pakenham, Berwick or into the local townships of Cockatoo & Emerald, where you'll find a wealth of fine cafes, restaurants, shops, schools and services. Neat as can be, the garden is mostly lawn with some stunning established trees providing dappled shade. Under the house there is a bonus room which is plaster-lined and currently houses the laundry and storage. It would work well as a studio or office, as it stays super cool through summer. The in/out driveway is another big plus.
There is a really homely feel to this property. The entrance hall has parquetry flooring with separate toilet and great sized bathroom. Both bedrooms have BIR and share the easterly view across the treetops. The main living space is open plan with doors that open onto the deck and onto the front shaded walkway. Crank up the pot-belly fire in the cosy winter months. The galley kitchen has lots of storage and bright yellow bench tops that have done the fashion merry-go-round and are looking pretty funky to me.
Come to the open and avoid disappointment. Properties like this do not last long.

cockatoo-vic-3781,7 Belgrave Avenue Cockatoo VIC 3781,"Rustic Charmer on 1 Acre Plus
Close to town, public transport and the local primary school, this characterful log cabin has everything that people move to the Hills for - peace, privacy & SPACE. An opportunity to update - have a google for ""log cabins painted black""!
Set on 4400sqm (approx.) and fully fenced, the block is alive with the sound of frogs coming from a large pond at the front entrance. There are many aspects to the garden including walkways, lots of beautiful planting (Victorian Christmas Bush, Weeping Acacias and Fruit Trees) large lawn spaces for the kids to play and a veggie garden.
A mass of wisteria greets you as you enter the large 4 space carport. This is a very serviceable area and includes an air-conditioned office and workshop converted from the double garage.
Step inside and you’ll find a perfectly presented and convenient home with an exceptional country kitchen. Cooking dinner at night is made easy with the size of the kitchen which also includes a built-in corner pantry, enough space for a double fridge, breakfast bar and an Ilve stove top.
There are 2 living areas - one that relates to the kitchen and another at an incredible size of 9x6m that comes with a quality 7' x 3.5' hydrolic pool table, that doubles as a dining table. Originally the space included a 4th bedroom so you could revert it to a 4th bedroom if that suits your growing family’s needs (STCA). Both lounge rooms offer wood fired heating – one is a large open fire and the other an old-school coonara style that can double as an open fire place.
All bedrooms are of good size with BIR’s and the master bedroom includes a “his and hers”.
And finally… after a long day’s work, you’ll enjoy nothing more than coming home to a glass of champagne and relaxing in the spa bath in the large main bathroom.
