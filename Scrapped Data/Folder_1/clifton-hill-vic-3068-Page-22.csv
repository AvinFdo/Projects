clifton-hill-vic-3068,164 Spensley Street Clifton Hill VIC 3068,"Historic Mountjoy...Once in a lifetime opportunity
With an extensive frontage of some 24 metres Mountjoy sits proudly on approximately 820 square metres of elevated ground with superb rear access.
Many have strolled past the chromatic tuck pointed brickwork facade including bay window with lion sentries standing guard over the entry and wondered just what lay behind the facade.
An inspection will impress and delight and give a glimpse of the wealth that the original owner must have possessed to build such a lavish home. The basics are still here and we trust a visionary will purchase the home and restore and develop it to the grandeur it deserves.
A wide hallway with intricate arched columns and some of the most elaborate etched stained glass windows frame the hall which leads to 5 rooms, the ones to the right linked between equally impressive archway openings and two on the left as original bedrooms. A wonderful depiction of the Mountjoy and Dartmouth stand emblazoned over the front door in red etched glass hinting at the provenance of the owner.
To the rear of the hall a modern style bathroom and kitchen were added within the structure in the 1960-70s but appropriately hide the narrow stair that leads to the original tower box room with maid style proportion including a small candle gas heater with gas wall lamp. ( neither operable). Other storage vestibules, amenity rooms and sheds make up the property though its fair to say the new owner is going to have some ‘ hard yards’ and sound thinking in front of them to make this the once grand home it was and deserves to be again.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"3
