clifton-springs-vic-3222,45 Boonderabbi Drive Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"Top Shelf!
It is very fitting that this fine property is positioned in one of Clifton Spring's most elevated pockets as it truly is 'top shelf' in every sense! Showcasing a stunning light & bright 'feel' this quality built residence will feel like home from the moment you turn the key.
• An attractive façade provides a hint to what is sure to be an outstanding inspection; stylish finishes are complemented by the unwavering brief to deliver a true 'lifestyle' home
• Upon entry you will be instantly impressed by grand proportions & towering exaggerated ceiling heights
• A central hub of this residence is a kitchen/family/meals zone which showcases great size & scale; crisp neutral finishes, expansive windows & an enviable orientation further enhance a wonderfully light & bright experience
• The kitchen serves up an eye catching design; expansive benchtops, custom high gloss cabinetry, feature tiled splash back, induction cooking, stainless steel appliances & a walk in pantry provides excellent storage solutions.
• 4 generous bedrooms; master is complete with a beautifully appointed ensuite & walk in robe. All additional bedrooms are equally generous & have BIRs.
• A 2nd independent living zone provides further flexibility to what is already an adaptable floor plan; a trio of floor to ceiling windows perfect frame landscaped gardens
• All the modern comforts; ducted gas heating, evaporative cooling & quality fixtures throughout ensure all year comfort (& boasts a 7 star rating)
• Dual glass sliding doors off the main living area create a seamless inside/outside living area. A fully equipped hardwood decked alfresco under the roofline creates a beautifully sheltered space for the 'entertainer'; an established hedge across the rear boundary provides a private setting.
• An impressive feature of this home & one of my personal favourites is the authentic Balinese hut; complete with a shingle roof, hardwood deck & a bench seat. It provides another space for the 'entertainer' with a WOW factor
• It's very difficult to find a property in today's local property market that nails the 'lifestyle' brief better; a double remote garage is complemented by an independent carport with side access (secured by dual timber gates & an exaggerated clearance of approximately 2.7m) further endorses a genuine one of a kind feature; room enough for the cars, boat, caravan & even the jet ski.","SOLD - $599,250","4

Looking to play a lot of Golf or Bowling and don't want too much to do at home? Well this unit might be the perfect downsizer for you to achieve your goal.
Or maybe you like the idea of buying an investment in an area where the prices have seen a great growth over the last 12 months of around 14.6% and you want to buy to be ahead of the future growth.
A short walk to the golf course or the bowling club means you can also fit in your exercise.
Never heard of Clifton Springs? A suburb that has taken a while to become known is now a suburb of choice for many offering all the amenities required for day to day living and playing.
Having lived here for over thirty years I have realised that even though it has grown it has not lost its historic appeal or peacefulness away from the hustle and bustle. You do not have to travel far to get groceries or visit the doctor or even ride your bike.","SOLD - $375,000","2
