clifton-springs-vic-3222,34 Yarramundi Drive Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"ROLL YOUR SLEEVES UP AND GET DIRTY
One of the original homes in Clifton Springs that was designed to enjoy the views from the front porch. The warmth of timber floors and large windows letting the light in are lovely features which make you feel right at home as soon as you walk in. Be warned this is a ""big project"" home.
In a suburb that is yet to reach its peak, where you can achieve a lot of house for your money. It's a great time to buy before the prices increase as these homes will be harder to come by. With a bit of time and money this home could be restored to its former glory. Are you up to the challenge?","SOLD - $279,000","2
