We are all taking extra measures to protect our clients and staff from coming into contact with the virus. Please help us by respecting our request that you do not attend an Inspection or the office if you have:

- Recently been in contact with someone diagnosed with Coronavirus
- Recently been overseas
- Agreed to any self-isolation conditions
We also ask that you practice social distancing from anyone attending the office or at a private inspection, and where possible refrain from touching surfaces.

cockatoo-vic-3781,37 Lisheen Road Cockatoo VIC 3781,"Scandi design in bush idyll
Immerse yourself on over an acre of rainforest in this split-level delight of a fairy tale home. The living is open plan and the feeling is cosy enriched by small details and handmade touches everywhere. From little shelves and tiny high up cupboards to the hardwood floors, this home is full of warmth and a cohesive Scandinavian attitude.
The kitchen is a rustic triumph with handcrafted Merbau hardwood cupboard doors. The contemporary open shelving is up to the minute, as is the breakfast bar. It is completed with a sleek Smeg oven and gas stovetop. The adjacent meals area sits under a large sunny window overlooking the lovely courtyard.
Step down into the living space where a wall of windows invites you to soak up the forest view. This relaxing space is a joy in winter, centred around the wood-fired heater. In summer months you can turn on the split system or open it up to the veranda and while away the time, listening to birds and Cockatoo Creek burbling away. The regenerated native bush features a walking track through the ferns down to the creek where you can watch for wombats, echidnas, and wallabies.
The master bedroom looks out into the bushland and has rolling barn doors tucking away the walk-in wardrobe and ensuite. The second bedroom overlooks a gorgeous waratah and the third features a rolling french glass door. The monochrome and sage bathroom is a design masterclass.
If you are looking for a home with heart and a happy-ever-after get straight to the open for this one.","SOLD - $601,500","3

cockatoo-vic-3781,3 Woodrow Court Cockatoo VIC 3781,"EQUINE RETREAT WITH FLAT DUAL OCCUPANCY
A sweeping driveway, at the bowl of a private court location, guides you to a beautiful mudbrick farmhouse at the heart of a property that packs a punch. 6 fully equipped horse paddocks just a picturesque 7-minute ride to the arenas and cross country jumps at the Cockatoo Pony Club. Living here can be as energetic or as laid back as you like. Home-laid eggs for breakfast on the deck overlooking the mature orchard after a meditation session or take a relaxing trail ride along the horse trails of nearby Paternoster Road.
The Knox-esque house design uses reclaimed timber and church leadlight windows that add endless character and charm to this spacious home. The dormer window along the centre of the roof ensures light in every room. Each window is a feature in itself even before you look through them. The current set up is as a dual-living with a 2 bedroom fully self-contained flat - lending itself to older parents and equally suited to a twenty-something or two, as a lodgement or a bed and breakfast.
The Main House
The vast blackwood kitchen compliments slate-flooring in the kitchen and meals area. A conventional oven and stove-top alongside an impressive standalone Vulcan wood-fired stove. The kitchen opens into the mudroom/laundry which has space for all of your boots and saddles - the garage, sheds, and yards await you beyond. Back on the other side of the meals area there is a powder room which also serves as a semi-ensuite for bedroom 4.
Rustic balustrades on the spotted gum hardwood floors divide the open plan living. With a wood fire heater at one end and an open fire at the other and french doors in the middle, your all-season comfort is assured. There are 4 bedrooms in this part of the home. 3 have built-in robes and the master enjoys an ensuite and walk-in wardrobe. The light and bright main bathroom delights with its naturalistic stone setting.
The Granny Flat
Entirely self-contained with no steps or stairs and private access through a double leadlight door. It is a charming, private and comfortable space with two bedrooms; one with a large bay window. Both bedrooms have ensuites and walk-in-robes.
Outside for entertaining, you can choose between the back veranda with fire-pit, the spacious north facing front entertaining deck or the bonfire area. The horses have a host of features to enjoy: An all-weather round yard, feed and tack room, hitching rail, large open twin paddock shelter with side hay storage, small closed stable, open stable/hay storage, pony paddock/sickbay, wash bay, water trough and taps in each paddock, 3 gate paddock flow for pasture management, plus a host of other amenities.
Ensure your serenity by visiting this outstanding property.","SOLD - $1,020,000","6
