cowes-vic-3922,5 Longridge Street Cowes VIC 3922,"A Great First Home/Invester
Central to everything
Situated in the tranquil Shaolhaven Estate, this delightful residence is convenient to everything and only six months old.
The home offers three bedrooms, all with built-ins, a modern bathroom, with separate toilet, and a spacious open-plan living area overlooking the wetlands, currently under development. The living area has reverse cycle air-conditioning and the spacious kitchen has electric cooker, wall oven and a dishwasher.
Everything is new, ready for immediate occupation; just move in with nothing left to do. The home is a five to ten-minute walk to the beautiful Red Rocks Beach where nature often puts on spectacular sunsets. The Cowes shopping precinct, where there are supermarkets, medical facilities, restaurants and wonderful coffee and specialty shops, is also within walking distance.
From the end of the estate, buses are available to Newhaven College and Wonthaggi Secondary College. Cowes Primary School is only down the road, easily accessible by foot or bike. There is also a regular V-line service to Melbourne from Cowes. For those who fancy a tee, the Phillip Island Golf Club is just on the other end of Cowes and for keen anglers, the beach is virtually a stone's throw away. Cowes Jetty is also a popular location for a spot of fishing.
While the swimming beach is just down the road, Cat Bay, part of the National Surfing Reserve and the beaches of the Summerland Peninsula, is only a 5-minute trip by car, as are the Penguin Parade and the Nobbies Centre. For landlubbers, the Cowes Recreation Reserve provides opportunities to participate in team sports and a workout at the YMCA.
Either as an investment property, holiday home or an opportunity for first home buyers, this residence is a perfect package. And with such a perfect price, it will not remain long on the market. Contact Leanne Poulton on 0437 441 127 to arrange an inspection. This home will win you over.
