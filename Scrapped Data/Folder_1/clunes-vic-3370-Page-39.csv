There are lovely views to be had from the property and with the home being set back from the street, a great sense of privacy is had. The abode has a wondrous feel of warmth. Timber features throughout and combustion heating certainly add to the ambiance. All room sizes throughout are very generous taking large suites and the two living rooms can host many guests. These lead out to a vast outdoor entertaining area.","SOLD - $500,000","4
