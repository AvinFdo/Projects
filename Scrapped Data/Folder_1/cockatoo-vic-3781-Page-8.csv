cockatoo-vic-3781,30 Joffre Parade Cockatoo VIC 3781,"Storybook Heaven & The Shed of Your Dreams
THIS IS NOT A MIRAGE!
Stop pinching yourself. This character 3 bed weatherboard cottage with mezzanine level & under house storage can be your own little oasis.
""The Cottage""
Enjoying a northerly aspect on a relatively flat plot of land you may find it hard to decide where to enjoy it from - there are so many places for quiet contemplation. Inside, the main open plan living incorporates a galley kitchen, meals space & cosy fire-side lounge. A mezzanine level above offers more living and an entirely gorgeous attic bedroom. 2 further bedrooms, a renovated bathroom with heated towel-rail, storage room & utility/laundry/pet space complete the set up of this well built, well maintained pocket rocket of a home.
""The Shed""
Now I, like the next lady, can get excited by a good shed but this is on another level. To fully comprehend this shed, I recommend looking at the floor plan. With concrete floors throughout, a single roller door and bifold doors open up the front for vehicle access into the automotive workshop. Barn doors lead into the metalwork space and at the rear a woodwork room with built-in cupboards, kitchenette & bathroom fitted out completely using recycled materials. There is also a spray booth.
""The Gardens""
This is an all seasons garden designed for ""pottering"" and includes Azaleas, Hakeas, Mini-Cogs, Roses & just wait for the spring bulbs to pop up. The front garden provides privacy from the road and can be enjoyed from the veranda. The fully landscaped rear garden leads you up the garden path, past a fish pond and over a creek and a look-a-like old mine shaft. Bird life can be spotted from the tranquil shed veranda or the outdoor entertaining deck.
Two driveways lead in to the property with space for vehicles behind the two sets of gates as well as in front.
