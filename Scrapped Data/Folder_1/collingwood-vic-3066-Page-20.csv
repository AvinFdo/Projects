collingwood-vic-3066,17/78 Oxford Street Collingwood VIC 3066,"STYLISH & CONTEMPORARY WAREHOUSE APARTMENT OOZING NEW YORK FLAVOURS
Nestled in the heritage Foy & Gibson Woollen Mills warehouse, this remarkably elegant and secure inner urban domain is one of few remaining in Collingwood.
A modern and working kitchen features SMEG appliances and flows through to the open and airy dining and living space. Polished concrete floors open out onto a fabulous private terrace bathed in natural light, ideal for entertaining or a weekend breakfast in the sun.
Two ample, carpeted bedrooms include BIR's and wall heaters, with the master opening to the terrace. These are separated by a central bathroom and a European laundry with plenty of storage.
Factor in high ceilings, reverse cycle AC, secure entrance with video intercom, secure lower level carpark and a storage cage and the property's appeal deepens.
Enhancing this further is its superb location; a stone’s throw from Smith Street bustling cafes, restaurants and shopping precinct, with trams, buses and trains nearby to access the heart of Melbourne City and the Sporting precinct.
