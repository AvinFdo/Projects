clayton-south-vic-3169,2 Granville Grove Clayton South VIC 3169,"A North-Facing Corner Delight!
Venture down the pathway of future success with this rewarding three-bedroom home, which stands on a coveted 630sqm (approx.) corner block shining brightly with opportunity and a desirable Northerly aspect.
That opportunity presents itself in the form of development, given the scope to build a collection of contemporary units with their own frontages (STCA). Of course, theres also the option of retaining the neat and tidy single-level home and renovating it into your ultra-modern family residence.
Perfectly liveable, you could also line your pockets with income by leasing the home whilst plans and permits are being approved.
Just when you think it cant get any better, it does when you factor in the sought-after location thats only a short stroll to Namatjira Reserve and just minutes away from Clayton train station, Clayton Community Centre, Clayton shops and local schools.
