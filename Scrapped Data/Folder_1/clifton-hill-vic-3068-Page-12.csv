clifton-hill-vic-3068,25 Hodgkinson Street Clifton Hill VIC 3068,"'Coverdale c1880'
With only its second offering to the market in almost 100 years, this impressive double fronted brick Victorian strikes a commanding figure from the street resting upon an exceptionally rare parcel of land in Melbourne's increasingly popular inner-north (861 sqm approx). Sympathetically updated to restore the home's period allure, you're immediately struck with a sense of space and grandeur from the wide hallway entrance, ornate ceilings, OFPs, Baltic Pine floors and high ceilings throughout. The expansive and light-filled home boasts a flexible floorplan that comprises 5 or 6 generously proportioned bedrooms with BIRs, an elegant formal sitting room with stunning marble OFP, a two-storey rear extension and a modern kitchen/meals area that flows onto the timber deck and deep, rear tree-filled garden with storage shed (ROW access), while the 2 upstairs bedrooms share a southeast facing return balcony with a spectacular treetop aspect and uninterrupted city skyline views.
