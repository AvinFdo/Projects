clifton-springs-vic-3222,26 Caravel Avenue Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"INVEST IN THIS HOME WITH VIEWS
We have this home where the tenants would be extremely disappointed if they had to move. Are you looking to invest in this location? In the last twelve months the property values in this area have increased by 12.5% since November 2017 (source CoreLogic).
It is the time to buy before the market out prices your purse. Living in this area for over 30 years I have seen so many changes for the better. We started with a small supermarket called Ansonâ??s, we have grown to have two Woolworths, an Aldi and a Coles. We have moved from two small medical centres to two large medical centres plus two smaller ones. We have increased from two local state primary schools to four primary and three High schools. Progress is good. With progress comes a good choice of lifestyle. Work, rest and play in this pretty part of the Bellarine Peninsula.
This home has been renovated so well you can sit and enjoy the view. Just a short walk to the waterâ??s edge. With a minimum of 24 hoursâ?? notice we can book an inspection.","SOLD - $450,000","3
