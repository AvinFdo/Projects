collingwood-vic-3066,1/77A Lt Oxford Street Collingwood VIC 3066,"Iconic, Individual Loft-Style Townhouse
The Smith Street pharmacist who built this now heritage listed, solid brick building as his laboratory back in the 1880's could never in his wildest imagination have foreseen the superb conversion that has created the totally cool 2 bedroom loft-style townhouse that now occupies the space.
Although part of the development at 77 Little Oxford Street, No.1 has a completely separate and secure street level entrance which opens onto a generous living space flooded with natural light from the floor to ceiling glass walled private courtyard. On the mezzanine level the bedroom includes an ensuite bathroom and walk-in robe while the ground floor bedroom has a built-in robe and the ensuite incorporates a recessed laundry. The open plan kitchen features a Caeserstone island bench, Nobel stainless steel gas appliances, tiled splashback and ample storage.
Other features include split system air-conditioning, floating timber flooring, secure single car space and storage cage.
Adding to the appeal of this highly desirable property is an ideal location in the heart of the Oxford Street precinct and within easy walking distance of Smith Street with its cafes, restaurants, bars, specialty shops and supermarket while either a short tram or bike ride will have you in the CBD or neighbouring Fitzroy.
The savvy owner-occupier or investor may also want to consider the option to gain excellent returns from listing the property with Airbnb as the current owner has done, achieving Super Host status, and with guests regularly commenting on how they love the brilliant location, the direct street access, the courtyard and clever mezzanine design.
