clifton-hill-vic-3068,129 Westgarth Street Northcote VIC 3070,"""Fabulous Westgarth"" What a find! Untouched Period Charm
Please register your interest in attending the open for inspection so that we can ensure compliance with the latest regulations.
Please also register your interest to attend the auction so that we can ensure compliance with the latest regulations and be contacted in the event the property is going to be sold prior.
A unique opportunity on a large, north-facing, corner allotment of 467 square metres (approx.) with rear car access, this character-filled and solid brick Federation-style home has been lovingly maintained by the same family - as 2 separate residences - for over half a Century. Perfect for multi-generational families, as an investment with sub-letting potential or for those needing a large home office with an independent entry, the home is also ready to be reinstated as one huge home, while the block is suited to a complete rebuild or even multi-residential redevelopment (STCA). The options are almost limitless.
Enriched by towering ceilings and fine period detail, the home currently presents you with a pair of kitchens - one with informal meals, a separate gas-heated lounge and a dining room, the other with a gas-heated lounge / dining. However you choose to use the spaces, there is plenty of flexibility while you live or lease and finalise your plans.
At least 5 of the rooms can be used as bedrooms, whilst there are also 2 bathrooms each with seperate wcs, 2 laundries, a rear garage and a garden shed in its substantial north-facing backyard.
Nestled between the village-like charms and cafe culture of Station St, the cosmopolitan action of High St and the vast natural open spaces of the Merri Creek parkland, it is easy to see why this is such a thriving northern suburban setting that also offers you the privilege of easy city access via Dennis Railway Station. Indeed, this is a location of enduring market appeal that is destined to reward your vision.
