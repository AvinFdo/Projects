collingwood-vic-3066,362 Wellington Street COLLINGWOOD VIC 3066,"Investigate ideas, pursue plans
Under Instructions From State Trustees.
One of Collingwood's most intriguing, individual properties - on a generous allotment - creates a captivating opportunity to consider re-development concepts or undertake a full scale renovation project, STCA. Either strategy suggests a rewarding outcome, complemented by the appeal of the location, close to schools, trams, shopping and within easy reach of the CBD. A warehouse style image introduces current day spaces comprising a dual level floor-plan of six principal rooms defined by timber floors, remarkable originality and an obvious readiness for revival or replacement. Flexible living, dining, accommodation or studio spaces accompanied by a basic kitchen and bathroom define the structure, while north easterly outdoor areas conclude with a garage and huge storage shed accessed from a convenient rear lane. An inner city property that's loaded with possibilities.

Northern light adds a significant natural asset to the already impressive credentials of this designer dual level apartment. Spaces that clearly make a strong statement of style include a living/dining area accompanied by a Caesar stone open plan kitchen and a sunny balcony beneath an elegant cafe awning. Reverse cycle heating/cooling, a study zone and an attractively appointed bathroom complete the lower level while above, two bright bedrooms, each with built in robes and their own heating/cooling, share a second, semi ensuite central bathroom. Secure storage cage and garaging accessed from second frontage to Budd Street mean convenience matches comfort and enhances an opportunity with evident lifestyle or investment appeal. The location makes its own substantial contribution too. Quiet, yet so close to Smith Street trams and the area's vibrant retail and restaurant scene, the stage is set for inner city enjoyment.

collingwood-vic-3066,328 Wellington Street Collingwood VIC 3066,"'Esk Cottage' More than affordable… More than comfortable!
Offering just that little bit more space than most terraces, this single front Victorian gem was extended in the 1980’s to create further ‘open plan’ living whilst also updating the kitchen and bathroom at the time… Whilst the renovation may have dated gracefully this delightful terrace remains extremely comfortable with plenty of scope to further improve at your leisure. Located only a short distance to the eclectic Smith & Brunswick Streets with their wide choice of eateries, cafes, specialty shopping and funky bars, buying in this location is sure to enhance your lifestyle while adding to your future wealth.
With a somewhat flexible floor plan the home comprises 2 double bedrooms, lounge/sitting room, informal living, timber kitchen with gas stove, bathroom/laundry and low maintenance rear courtyard.

collingwood-vic-3066,2/127 Cambridge Street COLLINGWOOD VIC 3066,"Inspired Warehouse Conversion by Carr Design
Featured in Belle magazine, this stunning warehouse conversion successfully marries contemporary design with an industrial, cool aesthetic. Positioned in the iconic Foy and Gibson precinct, the warehouse has been extensively remodeled and refurbished by one of Australia's most respected interior design and architecture firms, Carr Design.
Exposing the building's rich architectural heritage which includes original timber beams and trusses, Carr Design have inserted a new structure into the existing form which adds two loft-style bedrooms and a rooftop deck. This insertion creates a logical flow between the interior spaces, and adds two large voids flooding the living areas with natural light.
Upon entry is a large flexible space which can easily serve as a study, second living area, or a spacious home office. Original timber floorboards lead through to a stylish kitchen - with ample storage and integrated appliances - and an 11metre long bench, which can seat up to 12 people. Towards the rear is an open plan living area, which has soaring six metre ceiling heights, built-in shelving and dramatic floodlights. Two windows look out to the beguiling urban streetscape, providing an ever-changing kaleidoscope of colour and texture.
Upstairs features two spacious bedrooms both with built-in wardrobes. A contemporary, fully tiled bathroom which separates the bedrooms adds to the industrial feel. A spectacular rooftop deck has expansive views overlooking the city skyline, Studley Park and onwards to the Dandenongs.
Additional features include security entrance with intercom, secure car parking, heating, innovative design initiatives such as elevated flooring to conceal services and a concealed laundry and scullery. With Gertrude and Smith Street culture at your doorstep, the MCG around the corner, and the CBD just a short stroll away, inner-city living doesn't get much better than this.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"2
