The second building to the rear, built in the 1905 was originally the local chappel at Snake Valley servicing the Gold mining community of the time, with its stained glass windows and unique domed ceiling would make a fabulous home studio. It has been a labour of love by the present owner to bring these historic building back to their original glory.

Established gardens enhance privacy to the façade and provide a pleasant outlook for the living zones. A clever floor plan links the entrance area, formal living, formal dining, the kitchen, informal dining and living in a circular fashion. These areas have specific functions but can be used openly when entertaining. The entire area is graced with beautiful natural light from many floor-to-ceiling windows and merges with the expansive alfresco zone through 2 sets of glass sliders.
The kitchen boasts extensive hardwood cabinetry - everything will have a place! Electric Chef appliances include a cooktop, wall oven and grill. Stone bench tops are low maintenance and decadent.
The bedrooms extend from an internal hallway and can be shut off from the living domain. There are 2 queen-sized bedrooms with built-in robes adjacent to the laundry (sewing room) and spotless family bathroom with spa bath, shower, toilet and vanity. Terminating the hallway, the private master bedroom offers a walk-in robe and en suite with stone-topped vanity, shower, toilet and bidet.
The alfresco zone views the spacious and private backyard with a lush lawn, productive vegetable gardens, fruit trees, citrus and olives and lovely roses. This spacious party spot boasts a useful catering station or utility room with kitchenette, laundry facilities and storage.
Electric under-slab heating throughout. Reverse cycle AC, ceiling fans and ducted vacuum.
A circular driveway provides easy access to both the carport and DLUG. The well-proportioned garage offers great storage or workshop space.
