clyde-vic-3978,19 Waterside Circuit Sandhurst VIC 3977,"INSPECTION BY PRIVATE APPOINTMENT ANYTIME.
This stunning home has been thoughtfully designed and finished to a very high standard.
Built by Hotondo Homes and only 3 years old, those who missed out on land in the last stages of sandhurst have been given an second chance.
Limed timber flooring runs the length of the downstairs area creating a sophisticated ambience.
There is a great study nook adjacent to the kitchen/family zone which allows teenagers to do their homework whilst still feeling part of the hub.
The contemporary kitchen with waterfall stone benches and stainless steel appliances overlooks the inviting family room. Opening onto not one but two under roofline al fresco zones, this home was a born entertainer.
Upstairs you will find 4 generous bedrooms, master with sparkling ensuite and comfortable walk in robe. The other rooms all offer built in robes. The windows are furnished with crisp white plantation shutters providing class and privacy.
The fully landscaped garden beckons you outside and the location is impossible to beat. You are literally a stones throw to the spectacular Clubhouse and Health Club to take advantage of all Sandhurst has to offer.","SOLD - $815,000","4
