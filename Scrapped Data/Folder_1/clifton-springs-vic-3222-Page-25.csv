Located in the heart of Clifton Springs and built with a loving family environment in mind, this home truly is a one of a kind opportunity, you simply won't find anything else like it. Before even walking in the door, buyers will fall in love with the charm of this warm suburb and the stunning facade provided by the home.

Inside, the quality of the build is guaranteed to impress. Polished floorboards decorate the property all the way through, with high ceilings to emphasize the attention to space and detail throughout the home. The floorplan is purposefully open and light to create a warm family environment. This is exemplified by the luxurious main living area which has ducted heating and a split system air conditioner for climate control all year round, while there is a smaller second living to allow for additional privacy and comfort. The kitchen is spacious and modern with lavish stone benches, overlooking the main dining and living. The property is sitting on a 678sqm block, and truly, no space has been compromised in the floorplan. You'll find that each bedroom is large, while the main has walk in robes and a full ensuite to match.
Despite the beauty of the home's interior, you may find yourself spending a lot of your time outdoors, as it's been made into an entertainers paradise. The beautiful pergola area has decking all the way around the back of the main living, leading right up to a sublime outdoor spa area which is fully fenced and designed for use all year round. In the warmer months you'll appreciate the low maintenance backyard, which is the ideal place to host a barbeque or family gathering, and of course there's enough room for any pets or for the kids to play.
The cherry on top is the huge double garage which is fitted with panel lift doors, and if you have more than two cars, not to worry! There's ample space to park in the driveway as well as the side of the home. There is no stone left unturned in this property, call today and see for yourself.

clifton-springs-vic-3222,10 Panoramic Terrace Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"Huge Block, Outstanding Home, Spectacular Bay Views!
With a street name like Panoramic Terrace, you can assume there'll be a view of some sort.
Be assured, you won't be disappointed. Passing through the gates, you're immediately taken by the size of the block, which is dominated by a large concrete concourse and established lawn and garden that lead to the double-storey house with a double garage. On the western boundary are a fenced-off hothouse and a large storage/workshed. The home's entrance is marked by two pencil pines that lead to an impressive central passage. Off to one side is an office or potential extra bedroom, while on the other, double doors open to a light-filled sitting room. At the end of the passage, you're greeted by the large open-plan lounge/kitchen/dining area with delightful views of the impeccable terraced back garden and the substantial covered patio. If cooking's your passion, you'll be thrilled by the well-equipped kitchen with its island servery bench, Chef electric oven and gas cooktop, and a stainless-steel Dishlex dishwasher. Around the corner, there's a walk-in pantry, a laundry and a rear butler's pantry. The lounge has a ceiling fan and a gas log fire, and a sliding door to the covered alfresco entertainment centre with its striking water feature. Two bedrooms share a neat ensuite with shower, bath and vanity. Upstairs delivers the “wow” factor - a sensational panoramic view of the bay from the lounge and master bedroom - both with access to the north-facing deck. The bedroom also enjoys an ensuite with shower, twin basins and a separate WC. Making the most of Clifton Springs' wonderful coastal elevation, this outstanding and very private family home deserves your immediate inspection.","SOLD - $695,000","4
