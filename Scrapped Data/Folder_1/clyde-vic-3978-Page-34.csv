clyde-vic-3978,6 Fenfield Street Cranbourne VIC 3977,"Rare opportunity for First Home Buyers and Investors!
Sitting proudly on 640sqm approx. block of land is everything you've been looking for!
Featuring 4 large bedrooms (Master with en-suite and walk in robe) as well as an extra room for either a study or 5th bedroom. When entering the home you're greeted by a neat entryway with the master to the right and HUGE living zone to the left. Saying the living area is HUGE is somewhat of an understatement! A fully equipped kitchen with loads of bench space and storage options is right at the heart of the home and is easily accessible from two sides.
Separating the two living zones is a unique yet practical open fireplace that gives the ultimate ambiance throughout the winter! Although, if you're not one for lighting the fire the home is conveniently fitted with evaporative cooling and gas ducted heating assuring year round comfort! The home is also fitted with solar panels to ensure power bills remain low.
Out back is a lovely decked area amongst the yard we all wish we still had with plenty of space for your family and pets to play!
With all the above inclusions you wouldn't expect to be located in such close proximity to parks, multiple major shopping centres, schools (both primary and secondary) and easy access to both Cranbourne train station & Merinda Park train station!
Be quick to inspect as this property will not last long. So call Vikram on 0430392918 or Ajay on 0403351577 for further details.

clyde-vic-3978,81 Hardy Avenue Cannons Creek VIC 3977,"EXTREMELY RARE OPPORTUNITY TO OWN A SLICE OF WATERFRONT HEAVEN!
Far from the madding crowds, there is a little patch of waterfront paradise waiting for you. Less than an hour's drive south-east of Melbourne, at the northernmost tip of Western Port Bay sits the coastal hamlet of Cannons Creek. Set on nearly 1000sqm, this rural haven is one of only 12 properties backing directly onto the beautiful Rutherford's Inlet, where twin boat ramps and unimpeded water views await. However, this is much more than a standard sea change, it's a rare opportunity to secure that perfect country getaway you've been dreaming of. The contemporary designed 2 bedroom (another space may be converted to a 3rd bedroom) house is cute & stylish, with a light filled family room, spacious open plan kitchen/dining space and a separate study/office. With modern fittings and quality flooring throughout, and plenty of room on site for parking, this charming, low maintenance, beautifully located home is ready to go. Or, if you prefer, ready to renovate, redevelop or simply relax. (After all, it's your perfect life.) With access to the World Heritage listed Ramsar Wetlands and the gourmet pleasures of The Mornington Peninsula on your doorstep, this is nothing less than a slice of Aussie nirvana; either as is, or however you dream it. Because, out here, you have space. Are you ready to explore?
This unique and secluded coastal village is only 45 minutes (approximately) drive from the heart of Melbourne and close to the Eastern suburbs.
