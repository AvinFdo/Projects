This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to secure a large corner block in Clayton South's finest location. It would have to be an area equal to any of Clayton's finest streets.

Why Should You Buy????

clayton-south-vic-3169,16 Alward Avenue CLAYTON SOUTH VIC 3169,"Keep The Front And Develop The Rear (STCA)!
Standing on a flat 668sqm (approx.) corner block, future success is all but guaranteed with this well-presented home that's rich in potential. With the future owner granted the rare opportunity to retain the current dwelling, subdivide the allotment and develop the rear (STCA), it's an opportunity too good to refuse.
The home itself is defined by its contemporary appeal, made possible by the presence of polished timber floorboards, which flow beneath the high ceilings and reflect the abundant natural light that fills the home, creating an ambience that's warm and inviting.
Lounge on entry is generous in size and enjoys a front garden outlook, while an open kitchen is also spacious in nature and offers a worthy stage for the cook of the household to show off their culinary skills.
Three good-sized bedrooms provide plenty of comfort, while a large backyard is big enough to comfortably accommodate a brand new Townhouse with its own frontage (STCA).
This appealing home is conveniently located within a very short distance of Clayton Shopping Centre, scenic parkland, Clayton train station, bus services, Monash University, Monash Medical Centre and well-regarded schools.
