clifton-springs-vic-3222,15 Dumburra Avenue Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"You Do The Math!
Upon reflection this property will undoubtedly be recorded as one of 3222's most savvy purchases in 2017.
If you're a facts and figures purchaser then this double storey commercial building is the one for you!
Boasting an impressive build over two levels - down stairs shop front with thriving local business. A long term tenant offers excellent rental income -
an outstanding 3 bedroom apartment upstairs with finishes of the highest calibre and equally impressive water views
The facts and figures:
-Shop Front Rental Income - $18,720 p/a (inclusive GST) which includes council rates, water levies including sewerage and building insurance.
-Long term tenant with prominent local business (year 6 of 3x3 lease 31st March 2017) who has indicated a plan
to extend the lease agreement.
The upstairs apartment showcases a fine example of open plan apartment living. A sea of spotted gum timber floors, stainless steel appliances, luxury oversized shower, a double vanity and feature louvre windows offer just a hint to the 'spare no expense' attitude to this impressive build.
Other key features include:
-Covered alfresco zone, complete with outdoor kitchen with impressive water views across to the You Yangs
-10ft ceilings with several 13ft feature skylights to ensure an abundance of natural light.
-A spiral staircase and an additional outdoor terrace make a lovely garden feature.
-Enormous garage and workshop 11m x 5.7 (3.3 ceiling height); cleverly designed with an additional shower and powder room.
Simply too many other features to mention. Strictly by
private appointment only!","SOLD - $455,000","3

clifton-springs-vic-3222,142 Beacon Point Road Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"Water Views At A Basement Level Price!
The 3222 property market is running hot!! This charming entry level home with water views offers an exceptional buying opportunity!
A beautifully orientated split level design creates an elevated living zone complete with towering cathedral ceilings, Coonara heater and lovely water views. The 3 bedrooms are conveniently placed on the lower level as is the family bathroom.
An attractive feature of this property is one's ability to 'value add'; a generous area under the main living zone looks an obvious place to explore an extension (STCA) not to mention various other options to watch your investment grow.
A modern utility shed (9m x 6m) is complete with concrete flooring and double roller doors. A further unexpected characteristic of this property is the addition of solar panels.
Set on a generous parcel of land (601m2 approx) with established trees takes you back to the glory days of good old fashioned back yards; rear access offers further scope for the property.
This property possesses an envious location. It is a short stroll to the waters edge, the No.61 bus stop (Geelong Station) lands almost at your door step and offers easy access to all that is great about the Bellarine Peninsula.","SOLD - $367,000","3
