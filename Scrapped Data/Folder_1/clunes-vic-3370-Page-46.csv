clunes-vic-3370,21 Lone Hand Road Allendale VIC 3364,"Loughlin Park' - 197.68 Acres of Productivity
Loughlin Park' is located 20 minutes North of Ballarat, 15 minutes from Daylesford & 10 minutes to Creswick and offers 197.68 acres or 80 hectares on one title with two sealed road frontages. Highly productive, this farm is one of the best examples of Farm Management you will find.
Zoned Farming, the current owners have renovated the pastures and improved production with the application of poultry manure and lime, and have direct drilled 90% of pastures over the last 10 years. The soil types vary from Red, Grey to Black Loam. There are 10 paddocks with troughs fed by town water, 4 dams and an unequipped stock bore insuring an abundance of water in the toughest of seasons.
The undercover working improvements are outstanding with the cattle yards (handling 100+ head), scales, a vet crush and adjustable loading race combined with high quality lighting via 3ph and 240v power enables work at night. Three large hay shed that hold approx. 600 large bales plus a large machinery shed with 3ph power add to the properties working facilities. The property currently carries approx. 100 grown head of Angus cattle. There is also 9 additional acres in which are currently leased by the Vendors from council, and could potentially be carried on by the new owners (STCA).
A comfortable 3 bedroom brick veneer home with open plan living, electric cooking, gas hot water system, wood heating, reverse cycle air conditioning and town water makes for comfortable living. The home also has potential to be leased at approx. $250 per week.
This is a rare opportunity not to be missed as Loughlin Park Black Angus' are renowned quality beasts and all are A1 blood line. This property could easily be run as a horse breeding or agistment property as the facilities are easily converted if desired.
Note: 30 acres of sown pasture that produced 150 large square bales last year will be locked away for the new owner to cut hay (conditions apply). Available to purchase separately is the livestock and more than 500 straws of semen which are approx. worth between $100 - 500 per straw.
Bonus Inclusions: The Vendors will include approx. 300 big square bales plus 250 bales of silage and a quantity of lime and poultry manure. This has a current value of approx. $50,000
Expressions of Interest close 9th September at 4.00PM at the offices of PRD Nationwide Ballarat and PRD Nationwide Buninyong.

clunes-vic-3370,11 Elizabeth St Smeaton VIC 3364,"BEAUTIFUL 1.206 Ha ( 3 ACRES) IN CHARMING SMEATON
Here is the place to build your dream home! Picture-perfect north facing hillside block on Mill Hill with panoramic views across its gorgeous green valley and the Smeaton volcano's and historic bluestone Anderson Mill in the distance.
Don't let this chance pass you by. A further 2-3 acres of crown land (yours to utilise upon application to council) and the permanently flowing, trout-filled Birch's creek, clear and deep, run along the lower side of the property. It's a corner block with only more beautiful vacant land as your neighbour, quiet Elizabeth St on the upper boundary and even quieter Moorookyle St down the other side. You'll be only a few minutes' walk (700m) to the friendly town centre and local pub/store and just 20-25 minutes to Daylesford, 10 minutes to Crewswick and 30 minutes to Ballarat.
Great, easy access to power and town water but town water will probably be unnecessary as a solar bore has been installed to provide as much crystal clear, drinking quality mineral water as you need for free forever! Recently acquired current planning permit exists for large dwelling and garage. All the hard work has been done for you. This incredibly rare site is just waiting for someone to build the exceptional house it deserves.
Smeaton village offers an excellent lawn bowls club and community centre and a regular bus service. Wonderful, quiet, family oriented community and close to all your needs.","SOLD - $183,000",1.21ha,Vacant land,Sold by private treaty 20 Aug 2016,"11 Elizabeth St, Smeaton VIC 3364 was last sold in 2016.",0,https://www.domain.com.au/11-elizabeth-st-smeaton-vic-3364-2012898295,"Street Profile
