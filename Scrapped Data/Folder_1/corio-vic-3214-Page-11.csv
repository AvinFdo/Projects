Your search is over. You have found a home to own where there is simply nothing to do... but move in and enjoy. From the front lawns to the back fence, the effort and quality that has gone into this home is like nothing else you have seen. With a brand new kitchen, complete with modern appliances ,including a dishwasher, plenty of cupboard and bench space plus a clever breakfast bar that looks out to the serene backyard. The bathroom appears to have been lifted directly from a magazine, with the free standing bath, floating vanity, new shower, and concrete styled floor tiles. Each bedroom is generous, with new carpets and built-in-robes. The master is especially large. The light filled living room is vast, with a hidden study area or perhaps the perfect reading area. The freshly painted walls, along with the stunning polished timber hardwood floors, striking light fittings (& LED downlights), make for a stylish home. The gas heating and a air conditioner make it a practical home as well . Outside offers an oversized garage, plus a secondary corner entrance, plenty of space for any toys, boats, vans etc.. The low maintenance landscaped garden provides a feeling of a sanctuary in this quiet court location. Handy to Aldi, public transport, schools and offering easy highway access, it just doesn't get any easier/smarter/better... Inspecting this home is an absolute pleasure.
