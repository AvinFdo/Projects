This three bedroom cream brick home is as solid as the day it was built! The lounge has gas heating and has double doors opening onto the meals and kitchen. The kitchen has electric stove and loads of cupboards. It then leads to a sunroom which has an abundance of natural light coming through the wall of windows. Two of the three bedrooms have built in robes and access the generous sized family bathroom. The laundry offers a second shower and double trough. Externally there is a good sized yard and single garage with two bonus rooms adjacent which could be utilised as a sewing or scrapbooking room or just for storage. This home has lots of flexibility in the design and will not disappoint.
