Although this property is typical in appearance it is extraordinary in the opportunity it presents and is sure to excite all builders and developers. The current owners have done all the hard work in obtaining a planning permit to add a 2nd dwelling in the rear and have started to renovate the front house. With 3 original bedrooms (one now converted to a dining room) and an updated kitchen plus some plumbing work that has already been performed to renovate the bathroom and laundry make this property a real developer's dream. Not only is the property located on a massive 710 m2 block in the residential growth zone but what makes this property really special is the existing planning permit to add a 2nd dwelling and the fact that the current owners have already added the services to allow for the next step in completing the subdivision meaning that you can start the development project immediately.
