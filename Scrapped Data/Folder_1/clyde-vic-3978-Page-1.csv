With natural gas connected, this home offers natural gas cooking, wood heating in the living room plus a split system for extra convenience and ambient temperature control. Floor to ceiling windows provide plenty of natural light to filter through, whilst the neutral palette and cosy carpet form an easy and manageable combination of textures and warmth. A full width veranda to the front provides the perfect spot to relax and unwind, or head out to the massive elevated, split level rear deck which offers the perfect place to relax while overlooking the oval and natural bushland. A natural gas point is already installed to get your BBQ or outdoor heater up and running.
This sloping 650m2 allotment offers new colorbond fence and the additional under house storage creates extra features when storing or setting up children's play equipment. With some established trees and new plantings already taking shape, this property provides a private parkland right in your own backyard. Various walking tracks and St George Lake are virtually on your doorstep, which ensures plenty of attractions to keep family and friends entertained all year around. Just moments from the centre of Creswick and just 15 minutes to Ballarat city, this home would be absolutely ideal for first home buyers, retirees or just to downsize.
