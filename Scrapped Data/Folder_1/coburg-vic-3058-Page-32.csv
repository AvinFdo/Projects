coburg-vic-3058,34 Bruce Street Coburg VIC 3058,"Contemporary Charm
A testament to quality and style, this character weatherboard emanates high-calibre class. Period décor and modern elements offset the layout to perfection which takes into consideration the need for entertaining as well as reclining. Striking in appearance and functionality, the kitchen is well-equipped and easily services the open-plan family and meals area. A living room (with gas heater) provides for more intimate occasions while a covered deck is perfect for outdoor get-togethers. Excellent family zoning places the luxuriant bedrooms at the front of the home alongside a family bathroom. An additional bathroom is situated at the rear, well-placed for guests. As one would expect from a home of this standard, polished floorboards, split system heating/cooling, solar panels, an attic and a remote garage accessible from the rear lane round out the features list. Adding to the home’s incredible appeal, the superb locale places you close to Coburg West Primary School, Strathmore Secondary College, public transport and shops.","SOLD - $1,115,000","3
