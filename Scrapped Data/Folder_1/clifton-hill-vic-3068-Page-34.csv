clifton-hill-vic-3068,36 Rutland Street Clifton Hill VIC 3068,"Release Your Inner Renovator
Someday soon, such pure potential will no longer be discovered so close to the city. This Victorian's terrace facade conceals interior spaces that are ready to renovate - today. As an additional incentive to update and enhance today's two bedroom spaces, a generous north easterly back garden and laneway suggest options for further extending and introducing rear right-of-way (STCA). A period streetscape, proximity to Clifton Hill station, Darling Gardens, local cafes and bike paths by the Yarra inspires ideas for adding contemporary character to classical soul beneath original high ceilings. The time has (finally) arrived
