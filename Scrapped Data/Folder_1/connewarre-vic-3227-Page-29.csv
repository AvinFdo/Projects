The Hamptons-style kitchen exudes quality with stone bench-tops, a breakfast bar, and butlers sink. The walk-in pantry provides ample storage, while stainless steel appliances include an oven, 900mm gas cooktop, 900mm range hood, and dishwasher.
The Master Bedroom will delight with built-in robes, a walk-in robe, and luxe en suite. Graced with a clawfoot tub and frameless shower, this en suite perfectly blends irresistible style with high-end design. The main bathroom and powder room are both as equally stunning, with heated flooring and stone bench-tops featured in all. Two additional bedrooms (one with built-in robes), versatile fourth bedroom/ home office (with direct alfresco access), and the laundry complete the downstairs level.
