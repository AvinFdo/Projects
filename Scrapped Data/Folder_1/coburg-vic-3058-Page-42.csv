The perpetual pull of The Grove - an address continuously sought for its status as one of the inner-north's most attractive- is matched by the leafy appeal of this apartment where superb garden on title is the ultimate accompaniment. Two bedrooms (main with built-in-robe) and immaculate bathroom offering large euro laundry illustrate entirely comfortable accommodation. Stone surfaces in galley kitchen complement similarly stylish living/dining proportions that open instantly to the garden, a rare asset of inviting depth and character that's primed for private enjoyment. Storage, electric heating and off-street car space convey indispensable convenience, a quality that's complemented by easy scope for a contemporary renovation if so desired. Stroll along a street rich in period character to reach Merri Creek Trail, or towards Sydney Rd to partake in the array of its cafes and eateries.
