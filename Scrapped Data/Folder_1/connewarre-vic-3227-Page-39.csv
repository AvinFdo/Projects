connewarre-vic-3227,7 Bollinger Street Waurn Ponds VIC 3216,"Quality built home under 5 years old.
Less than 5 years old means this home has builders warranty and is eligible for $20,000 FHOG.
A beautifully built Porter Davis home stands elevated from the street and carries a unique blend of quality and affordability along with ultimate convenience in position. An easy commute is afforded with the train station and Ring Road close by, whilst the location is also minutes from everything including schools of all levels, Waurn Ponds Shopping Centre, Deakin University, Epworth Hospital and a 15 minute drive delivering you to the Geelong CBD or Torquay.
Hidden behind an unassuming facade, the free flowing and functional floorplan boasts open spaces, multiple living zones, 4 carpeted bedrooms and a high quality fitout throughout. Upon entry the smart use of space is evident as the wide open hall leads the way through the home highlighted by neutral tones and timber flooring.
Positioned at the front the generous 4.5m x 4.5m master boasts plantation shutters, his and hers walk in robes and floor to ceiling tiled ensuite, including a double basin. 3 bedrooms each with built in robes are serviced by a central bathroom, separate powder room and laundry which includes substantial walk in linen and direct access into the workshop and garage.
The rear of the home hosts the activity epicentre as open plan living provides the chef of the family with full view of all living zones both indoor and outdoor. The kitchen is fully equipped to include 900mm cooking, dishwasher, stone tops with breakfast bar and also features a butlers pantry.
Adjoining the dining area, a rumpus room can be shut off for additional living space, theatre room, home office or guest bedroom.
The climate is controlled year round by gas ducted heating and evaporative cooling.
When entertaining family or guests this residence has the innate ability to transform itself into a grand entertainer as a pair of large stacking bifolds open from the living and dining out onto the 12m x 4m decking with underroof alfresco that invites the North and East sun.
Additionally, plenty of open grass space and smartly planted fruit trees create a rear yard seldom afforded in modern estate living. Everything about the landscape, front, back and side, is designed for minimal maintenance.
The decking also returns back down the side of the home and into the double garage and an additional workshop ideal for the home handyman or for additional storage of a trailer, motorbike or small car.
With everything a family home should be and in a location where everything is close by, this property may represent the end of your property search.

connewarre-vic-3227,73/40 Coombes Road Torquay VIC 3228,"North reserve
We all know that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. However, some don't know that the best orientation a home can be is North Back. Why, you ask? Well, the sun arches from the east to the west and in winter this happens in the north providing the warmth, light and comfort we all desire. https://www.domain.com.au/news/shine-a-light-on-the-best-aspect-20140306-348ok/
I point this out because you will be draped in northern light if you are the lucky buyer of this HUGE block in Seachange Estate.
