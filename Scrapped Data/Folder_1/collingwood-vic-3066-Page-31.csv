Positioned within 5 minutes' walk of North Richmond Station and Victoria Parade trams, this former grain storehouse provides a fresh and modern aesthetic, whilst retaining an industrial warehouse feel.
The ""Islington Silos"" have made a defining contribution to the transformation of the once industrial hub into arguably the most sought after and trendiest suburbs in Melbourne.
Entering the apartment from the elevator, the generous entry foyer leads to an expansive open living and dining area before attention is drawn to the sophisticated and well-appointed kitchen featuring vast storage, generous bench space and top line appliances. The private balcony offers stunning views of the Melbourne CBD, with plenty of room to unwind and enjoy the company of friends.
The property includes three bedrooms; the master with walk-in robe and a fully tiled en-suite and two remaining bedrooms with built-in robes and plenty of natural light, and exceptional views.
Additional features include ducted heating and cooling throughout, video intercom entry, secure undercover car space with a substantial lock up storage cage, an entertaining area including BBQ and use of a well-equipped gym.
This property offers the very best of contemporary living; an abundance of space, light, architectural flair and urban chic and is immediately accessible to the all that Collingwood has to offer","SOLD - $895,000","3
