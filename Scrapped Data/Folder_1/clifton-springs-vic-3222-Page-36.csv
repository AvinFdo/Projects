Come in, take a seat and enjoy a coffee around the table. That's what you feel like doing when you come inside this lovely home. Zoned living with options of how you configure the rooms. Currently the vendor has two living areas but you could decide to make one living a main bedroom with enough room for parents to also retreat to that space, your call.
Moving here to be closer to family, our Vendors chose this home for its location in a quiet court; they have not been disappointed. All their daily living requirements are close at hand, for work, recreation and relaxation. It's time now for a change of location so this opportunity has become available for someone else to enjoy the serenity of this beautiful home. Clifton Springs has become a great suburb to choose to put down your roots. Never heard of it? Well why don't you come for a drive and explore this town and what it has to offer?","SOLD - $384,000","3

clifton-springs-vic-3222,4 Calumet Rise Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"Simply Breathtaking!
Without any hesitation I can confidently state this quality built property boasts some of the most outstanding water views in 3222. Sitting proudly from its elevated court location; it showcases expansive and truly panoramic water views; the You Yang Ranges are perfectly framed amongst a 'sea' of blue and the green tree tops.
Undoubtedly a 'top shelf' build in its day, this property possesses grand proportions and a sense of true quality. Commanding high ceilings; ornate cornices, an abundance of natural light, exceptional storage solutions and an uncompromising brief of quality fixtures and fittings.
The 'ground floor' believe it or not possesses lovely water views; cleverly the master bedroom (complete with ensuite & WIR) and the generous living area are orientated to capture the best views. A generous kitchen offers a great practical space and is further enhanced with a walk in pantry. Double glass sliding doors offer a seamless connection from the lounge to a beautiful outdoor entertaining area.
An impressive timber staircase links you to the upper level of this property; take a deep breath and brace yourself for 'THE VIEW'.
The layout of the upper level continues with the theme of general proportions; 3 generous double bedrooms all with built in robes and an expansive additional lounge/living area. Glass sliding doors step onto a full house length decked area offering commanding panoramic water views.
Boasting a double garage (remote), an additional carport fully built in with roller door and expansive off street parking to cater for the boat, caravan and the jet ski. Lovely established gardens flank the boundary and complete a very pretty picture.
Set on a generous 847m2 (approx) parcel of land within the tightly held Clifton Springs Golf Course precinct.
The Clifton Springs Boat Ramp is just down the street and easy access to all that is great about the Bellarine Peninsula.
Clifton Springs is no doubt a 'hot property' market; a property of this calibre, expansive land holding and boasting HUGE water views will ensure it has no peer in the market place. Call today for your private inspection of this truly one of kind property!
