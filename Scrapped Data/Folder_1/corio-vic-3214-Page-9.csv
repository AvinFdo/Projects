corio-vic-3214,18 Norfolk Crescent Corio VIC 3214,"OPPORTUNITY ARISES!
Say hello this 3 bedroom, brick veneer home that screams plenty of opportunity! Each bedroom comes with BIRs, there is a decent sized living area, a modernized bathroom, an open plan kitchen/meals/second living area, and a single lock up garage. The particular location of this home is extremely sought-after due to it only being a stones throw away from a school and close by to shops - this home is ideal for those looking for some convenience in their lives. There is a shop located at the front of the home, however this can be turned into extra living space, a rumpus room or even just a storage room if you're into your hobbies! Call Michael today to register your interest prior to the up coming Auction on 14th December at 11:00am 0417 338 391!","SOLD - $418,800","3
