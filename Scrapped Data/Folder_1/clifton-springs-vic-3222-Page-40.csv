Located in the ever popular Yarramundi Drive, only a short walk from the boat ramp, golf club, schools and public transport sits this extremely well thought-out and solid family home.
This home looks brand new - a real testament to the vendors who have meticulously maintained the property in their much enjoyed time in this home. With plenty of space for the whole family, this home comprises four great sized bedrooms with built-in robes, two generous living zones, a nice big kitchen with stainless steel appliances and storage aplenty, double lock up garage, ducted heating and evaporative cooling, a large undercover entertainment area and a very generous backyard for the kids.
We really could go on all day listing the great points about this property, but the only way to really know is to come along to an inspection and 'feel' it. They certainly don't build them like this anymore...","SOLD - $435,000","4

Both living zones flow to the covered front patio amplifying the delightful coastal atmosphere and bringing you closer to the views.

clifton-springs-vic-3222,125 Clifton Springs Road Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"OPEN, LIGHT, SPACIOUS AND PEACEFUL
Put your foot inside this front door and feel how light, open and spacious this lovely home is. Large windows bring the outside in and help you feel that you can unwind and relax. Imagine sitting on the couch feeling warm and cosy in front of the wood heater that very efficiently heats the living area through to the kitchen and downstairs bedrooms.
The hub of every home is the kitchen and this home is no different. The living room overlooks a manicured garden, then extend your vision to a rural view. Quiet and peaceful is how I would describe this home.
Upstairs is a large second living area with dormer windows again it is open, light and spacious. Main bedroom with Ensuite and WIR. The rear veranda has been built in and is currently used as a bedroom but the options abound for this area. The current Vendor has previously used it as a studio, feel free to use your imagination on how you would use this space. Large garage workshop completes this package. The Bellarine Peninsula has a lot to offer. Especially the suburb of Clifton Springs. My family and I moved here to give our kids the opportunity to enjoy country living without missing out on the daily things required to survive. Balance is what it is all about here. Work, live and play in a space that has all you need. Daily requirements such as Schools, Medical Centres and shopping precinct. Balanced with restaurants, cafes, walking tracks, sporting groups, golf, fishing. What is your bent? I am sure you will find this place will amaze you and tick many of your sea/tree change list. Why don't you write a pros and cons list after you have inspected this calming home.","SOLD - $455,000","3

Without doubt the feature that sets this property apart from its peers is the stunning open plan design. Floor to ceiling windows perfectly frame the outstanding panoramic water views. A fully renovated kitchen offers both stylish finishes and clever storage solutions with its oversized timber island bench top and feature industrial style light fittings. A spacious family friendly backyard is perfectly orientated to take in the afternoon sun. A paved entertaining area with dual shade sails offers further lifestyle comforts. A double lock up garage, single carport and ample off street parking caters for the car, boat and caravan. For those buyers wanting an opportunity to significantly value add to a property, may I suggest ""going up"" to capture even more impressive views (STCA), or, the no brainer is to extend off the front with a decked entertaining area (STCA).","SOLD - $385,000","3
