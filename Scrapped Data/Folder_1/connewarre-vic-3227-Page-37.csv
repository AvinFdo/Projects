connewarre-vic-3227,247 High St Belmont VIC 3216,"A rare opportunity!
This charming Weatherboard home built in the early 50s on a generous 661m2 block is an ideal renovation project or development (STCA). Located close to Belmont shopping strip and public transport it features 2 good sized bedrooms, bathroom, neat lounge and kitchen. With character features like decorative cornices, mantle and Baltic pine under carpet this really is a rare opportunity to buy a property in a fantastic part of town with heaps of potential. The layout has a bedroom to the right as you enter the home and the bathroom. To the left is the lounge. Moving down the hall the second bedroom is to the right and the kitchen to the left. The Laundry is located through the back door and to the right. Beyond this is a large rear yard with an expense of grass and fruit trees. The positioning of the house on the block lends itself to development. While the garage would need to be removed it has the requisite 3 metres between the home and the fence line. In such a sought after part of Geelong this really is a rare opportunity to develop for capital growth. Definitely worth a closer look!","SOLD - $505,000","2
