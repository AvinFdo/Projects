So youre thinking of downsizing but dont want to live in a shoebox and still want room for a visitor to come and stay? Look no further than this beautiful spacious 2 bedroom unit!
Youll love that its super low-maintenance, has a garage for your pride and joy and most of all perhaps - the proportions that make it feel more like a house than a unit!
Not just perfect for downsizers, great for first home owners too that like to entertain but cant be bothered tending to a huge yard. A neat little study helps you work from home, and your own private driveway accommodates several cars for when your friends come to stay (in good time!).
Timber floors and plenty of natural light combine to create that warm homely feeling, while central heating and a split system help in the more literal sense.
