Designed by the current owners and built using quality hardwood timbers, this much loved home has been a haven for the large family that has grown up here over the last 43 years. Situated on a completely useable block of almost 1/2 an acre, the family has made the most of indoor/outdoor living. Playing hide and seek amongst the lush setting which offers many quiet areas to contemplate life was a joy and on rainy days the full length verandahs offered a sheltered place to ride bikes and scooters or indulge in a tea party. These verandahs welcome a host of colourful native birds with king parrots that feed from your hands. The huge living room has an open fire as a centrepiece and this has been a favourite spot for the kids to sit with a warm drink and relax. Polished hardwood floors add beauty and serviceability to the meals area which adjoins the kitchen. There are four bedrooms, the master has its own ensuite and the family bathroom serves the remaining rooms. The fourth bedroom is enormous and was designed as a multipurpose space so that as the children grew, this area could become a rumpus room, work from home office or gym with its own access. Ducted heating ensures your comfort throughout the entire home. Outdoors there is an in/out driveway, double carport, steel garage and a variety of storage spaces. Meandering pathways lead to secret gardens that are home to a chorus of frogs that inhabit the ponds and there is a barbecue area and plenty of space for additional vehicles and toys. The kindergarten is a short walk away and the Secondary College, General Store, Bam Bams restaurant and bus stop is also walking distance. For the first time ever this home is being offered to the next family to enjoy as much as the original owners.

HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS IN THE CENTRE OF EMERALD
A home with history, charm, character and style is what everyone dreams of owning. Beautiful from head to toe and graced with features of wrap around verandah, fretwork, ceiling roses, wide skirtings, timber lined ceilings and Baltic pine floors, the timeless appeal is evident from head to toe. The formal lounge has a solid fuel fire as a centrepiece and is the perfect place for those cooler evenings. You will be the envy of every chef with the 900mm Belling stove that has gas hotplates and two ovens plus a separate grill which will allow you to cook up a feast for the family in the central timber kitchen. A cosy meals/family room adjoins this section of the home and has French doors that lead out to a covered decked area complete with a spa. There are four bedrooms, one on the ground floor and the remaining upstairs featuring attic style design with doorma windows, tasteful décor and built in robes. The master is serviced by a full ensuite and has a parents retreat adjoining which could also serve as a study or reading room. The family bathroom is complete with a bath and there is a third toilet downstairs. The attention to detail is outstanding throughout and includes ducted gas heating, split system air-conditioner, 3 kw solar panels and double carport with roller door. Surrounded by a leafy established garden with plenty of space for children and pets, this is a unique opportunity to secure a slice of Emeralds history (we are told this property was originally the Emerald Post Office).
