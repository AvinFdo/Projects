Lift access to the exclusive 5th-floor precedes a perfectly-designed, practical interior instilled with outstanding modern style and superior-quality features and finishes while retaining its rich original spirit with high 3.8m ceilings, thick exposed brick walls and double-glazed arched windows. Adjoining a covered alfresco terrace, the open-plan living and dining area incorporates a stunning Miele-equipped marble kitchen leading to 2 sizable bedrooms with built-in robes, beautiful bathroom and a laundry. There's also linear ducted heating/cooling, video intercom, wool carpets, dark oak floors plus on-title basement car space and private storage cage.
