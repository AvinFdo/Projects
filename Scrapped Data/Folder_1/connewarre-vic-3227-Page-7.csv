What the VENDOR LOVES:
""When we decided to make the move to Torquay we wanted an open plan with light filled rooms which gave us an inside outside feel. Where we built is in a very friendly neighborhood and in a quiet street, it has the added advantage of being only 1 km to the beach and quite often we hear the surf crashing on to the shore. We also enjoy the Torquay lifestyle.""
