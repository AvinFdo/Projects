clayton-south-vic-3169,39 Tarago Crescent Clayton South VIC 3169,"Price Reduction. Vendor Says Sell!!
Family home or great investment opportunity. This property offers 5 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. It has been very well cared for with all maintenance done and not a dollar to spend. Your tenants could just move in and start paying the mortgage for you. The expected rental return would be between $550.00 and $600.00 per week.
Alternatively, what a great family home to move in to yourself with accommodation for the in-laws, or the teenager who is quickly growing up, offering those often desired for separate living areas. There are many extras attached to this home including a fabulous outdoor entertaining area for all seasons. Don't miss this one, come along and have a look on the weekend at the Open House or ring the office and make an appointment.
