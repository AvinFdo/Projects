With creative vision this four-bedroom, solid brick coastal home could become your dream abode or a sound investment with rental options or a savvy site for development (STCA). The options are bountiful and only limited by your imagination!

Further along the hallway are two bedrooms with BIRs, main with an en suite, a central bathroom, separate WC and optional study.
As it is the existing property has been modified for holiday makers with a third bedroom, en suite and lounge room located at the rear. Private access is attainable from the driveway and sliding doors lead you to an undercover al fresco space. This is calling out for an Airbnb host!
