cockatoo-vic-3781,1 Como Street Emerald VIC 3782,"Lo-COMO-tion!
This house is doing a brand new dance, having been lovingly refurbished with luxurious wall to wall carpets, fresh paint throughout and modern window treatments in every room. Yet it retains scope to put your own touches on it.
Glimpse Puffing Billy passing by just behind the azaleas or dance to his chug-a-chugging in either of the two good sized bedrooms with BIRs or the large master which is served by a full ensuite.
The wrap-around views from the living area will make you happy, particularly when illuminated by a summer sunrise. But with an excellent ducted system a misty winter day is just as good.
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul has been poured into the kitchen with gorgeous stylish green glass splashbacks, and brand new stainless steel appliances. It has an open plan design overlooking the spacious dining room and original bar.
Replete with a new standalone studio/craft room crafted from glass and light which makes for an ideal space to take on any project; containing a convenient kitchenette and computing connections. There is also a man cave below with enough room to swing a cat, or indeed your hips.
So come on, come on, do the lo-COMO-tion with me at the open for inspection.","SOLD - $700,000","3

cockatoo-vic-3781,172 Spillers Road Macclesfield VIC 3782,"Health & Wellness Lifestyle ~ Tri-Level Country Mansion
Ticks boxes you never knew you had
There can be no doubt that a life well lived is a life that is connected to its place in the universe. Willunga Estate is firmly established in a highly desirable country location where you can feel safe & secure to indulge in the pleasures of connecting to nature. Watch the sun rise and the colours of the sunsets play along the distant mountain ranges, follow thunderstorms across expansive skies. Take a walk around the 10 acres, breathe in clean air and meet the local wildlife. Ride the horses or bikes. Eat the produce from your own garden. Enjoy the peace, quiet, space & privacy. Star gaze.
There is simply no excuse not to live your best life here. After an early morning dip in the indoor solar heated salt-chlorinated pool & work-out in the adjacent gym you'll be unstoppable.
As a retreat from the stresses of life the home itself offers flexible accommodation, a solidity and well-built luxury that many buyers seek but rarely find in rural locations. Situated in the Yarra Ranges with excellent access to the Yarra Valley & delightful Hills villages.
If you are a large family or seek living with extended family members I thoroughly recommend you check out the floor plan. You will see how you can be amply housed in the many living spaces and bedrooms. The master wing with magnificent views, large walk in robe & ensuite is buffered from the rest of the household by a formal lounge. Upstairs, the further 5 bedrooms - all generous in size - have use of the separate w/c, bathroom, shower room & hand wash room. If not for a family this would work well for multiple guests.
Balconies are the first step outside and then onward to a large flat lawn with 6 fully fenced paddocks, a spring-fed dam, a grassed ménage & more beyond. A second entertaining space allows the adults and the kids to hold rival parties. Abba versus Eminem!
I could go on and on but I think you need to come and experience Willunga yourself. Why? Because you deserve it.
The features include:
10 acres
6 large bedrooms
Master wing
3 split levels, lowest level for recreation gym/rumpus/pool

The kitchen is central to the living area, providing an abundance of cupboard space, stone bench tops and stainless steel appliances. With 3 living areas and 2 dining/meals areas, there is enough space for everyone, and a ducted vacuum adds convenience. Ducted heating and evaporative cooling keep the home comfortable.
Outside, a large undercover entertainment area overlooks the expansive, relatively flat garden. Feed the family with an abundance of fruit from trees including apricot, mandarin, lemon, orange, olive, walnut, fig and mulberry, plenty of space for growing veggies, serviced by 2 garden sheds. This is a haven for children to explore and parents to build the likes of a garage, workshop or shed, Dependent Persons Unit or home extension (STCA). 14 x 250W solar panels with 4000W inverter assist with the power bills.

cockatoo-vic-3781,4 Brookdale Avenue Emerald VIC 3782,"Make a REAL Difference
A 2 acre (approx) Ecological Sanctuary Nestled in a Hidden Valley
Glen Luce or Valley of Light is a conservationists dream, tucked away at the end of a cul-de-sac. Only minutes from the main township, as you enter the gated property you are transported into a magical wonderland.
In a time of existential climate crisis this is your opportunity to take part in the healing of the planet.
A passion project of the current owners who have re-vegetated a significant portion of the property with Indigenous and Gondwanan species.
As you journey through the property you will be touched by the love and patience bestowed on this parcel of land that is linked to the Menzies Creek nature corridor. Complete with walkways, footbridges and information plaques telling the stories of the native flora and fauna - this is like a jurassic theme park (minus the dinosaurs). Ferns are dotted along the two streams that run through the property, and a hidden bamboo forest accessible over one of the many footbridges is a childrens playground paradise. A resident bower bird has adorned his nest with lots of blue trinkets, and you can view him doing his bower dance in the shade of the gazebo. A nature-enthusiasts dream-land, with tree branches teeming with crimson rosellas, honey-eaters, kookaburras and king parrots as well as a regularly sighted echidna, wombats and yabbies.
The environmentally designed, one owner mud brick home sits nestled towards the rear of the property with a true north orientation. The home itself spans three levels, with a particularly adaptable floor plan. On the upper two levels you will find the north facing open-plan living area, with French doors opening onto a light soaked patio, perfect for entertaining all of your family and friends. As you make your way inside, you come to the recycled timber kitchen and walk-in pantry, with plenty of space to make good use of all of the yummy goodies grown on the property. A mud room/laundry room and bathroom complete this level. Continue upstairs where views from each room leave you feeling as if you are floating amongst the ferns. You will find two good sized bedrooms, one with built in robes and the other with an ornate antique wardrobe. There is a third bedroom or study, and ample storage space.
The versatility of this home lies in the lowest level, which was previously used as a therapists clinic and comes equipped with another two rooms, kitchenette, storage space under the stairs and in the hallway, as well as direct access onto a beautiful deck overlooking the spectacular grounds. The beauty of this floor plan means B & B potential, a separate living space for relatives, a home business or simply a large, single family home.
This home would suit someone with an appreciation for rustic charm and natural materials, where the outside is invited into every room. Here, mother nature meets environmental design, with high ceilings, louvre and highlight windows that can be opened to let heat out and assist with cooling in the hot Australian summers. You dont need to go without creature comforts however, with a wood heater, gas heating, ceiling fans, 14 solar panels and an instantaneous gas hot water system ensuring year-round comfort.
Complete with veggie patch, a plethora of producing fruit trees, a giant chestnut tree shading the 4-6 car carpark, and two 25,000 litre water tanks you will have an abundance of fresh produce year-round. Also boasting an additional 2 car carport, an underground cellar for storing all of your preserved fruits and veggies (or all of your alcohol) and a third 20,000 litre water tank to house excess winter water.
To truly capture the essence of this property, you need to take the time to wander the grounds. This property is far more than a house on a parcel of land it is an experience. Make sure you give yourself ample time, because you wont want to leave.","SOLD - $970,000","4

cockatoo-vic-3781,5A Old Beaconsfield Road Emerald VIC 3782,"A Lovely Life at Tudor Leigh
Bluestone gates welcome you into the world of Tudor Leigh. Set on 3 and a half easy-care acres, it provides all you could require to lead a truly lovely life.
The 2 storey Tudor house set in the middle of the block delights with a picture-perfect outlook from every window. Spend your mornings in the large country kitchen bathed in sunshine. The heart of this home supplies all the space you need for the most ambitious cooking project with 6 gas rings, extra-large oven, and double pantry. The slate flooring flows from the kitchen into the informal living area with wood-fired heater to snuggle around.
From there you step out into a large covered outdoor entertaining area where you can host parties with ease. The outdoor kitchen has a BBQ, stove, and the fixings for a beer tap so you and your guests can sit in comfort as you soak up the sounds of the bushland.
The garden is well established, full of camellias and maples alongside the native eucalypts. It offers large scope to improve your green finger with a poly-tunnel waiting for you to begin your own food forest. A fully fenced paddock with loose box is ready for a pony or alpaca if the fancy takes you. With sheds aplenty and three gated access points, space is never an issue at Tudor Leigh.
Enjoy your nights in front of the gas log fire in the elegant formal living area whose exposed brickwork is lifted with white paint to lend a French provincial air, and beautiful formal dining for special evenings. Two single bedrooms, currently used as his and hers studies, a large laundry and w/c complete the downstairs.
Ascend the stairs from the entrance hall to the upper floor landing and the spacious master suite with a WIR and FES. Relax in the claw footed bath of the main bathroom. 3 further double bedrooms with BIR will provide comfort for your slumber.
This private property is perfectly positioned in proximity to the centre of Emerald, so make it a priority to explore!","SOLD - $950,000","5
