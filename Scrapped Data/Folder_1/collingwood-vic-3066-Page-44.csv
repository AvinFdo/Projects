Formerly a corner butcher shop and separate terrace house, this historic double storey Victorian property is now an exceptionally spacious and well-renovated family residence, combining period character with modern style. Entry is to a well-proportioned sitting room, leading on one side to a sunny home office/fourth bedroom (formerly the corner shop), and on the other to a good-sized dining room, separated by a cut out wall from the kitchen, equipped with Bosch appliances. Set to one side of the dining room is a second living room, where French doors open to the brick-paved northerly courtyard. At the rear of the house is a new two-zone bathroom and concealed laundry, with door and louvress to the courtyard (compact off-street parking from Charlotte Street). Upstairs are three further double bedrooms (two with CBD views), a second tiled bathroom, a large fitted study/retreat opening to a north facing expansive roof terrace from which you can pick your very own peaches.
This warm and inviting property features polished concrete floors, open fire places and other period detail, quality cabinetry, heating and reverse-cycle air conditioning. Gold Street Primary, Queens Parade cafes, Smith St and transport are within easy walking distance.

collingwood-vic-3066,72 Gold Street COLLINGWOOD VIC 3066,"SPACE, COMFORT AND COLLINGWOOD HISTORY
This wide block-fronted residence, built in 1917, is next door to the birthplace of the legendary John Wren, whose first betting business was centred around Gold Street and the adjacent laneways. A wide hallway opens from the front verandah to three exceptionally spacious and well-lit bedrooms. Double doors lead to the well-proportioned living and dining room, open to a modern kitchen with polished concrete floors. To one side is a good-sized bathroom, with free standing clawfoot bath and separate shower, and a laundry recess. Timber and glass folding doors open to a pergola and bluestone paved courtyard to two sides. Featuring timber floorboards and reverse-cycle air conditioning, here is a sunny family home providing comfortable living for many years to come, with potential to add further value in a rapidly appreciating precinct close to cafes, transport and freeway access.
