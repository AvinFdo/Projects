clunes-vic-3370,1140 Werona-Kingston Road Kooroocheang VIC 3364,"Daylesford District Former School House & School, Ideal B&B
Filled with character, oozing charm and offering a chance to celebrate its history, this delightful original school house lends itself beautifully to that sought after rural retreat or peaceful weekender for a couple or an opportunity to maintain its current operation as the School House Bed & Breakfast.
High timber ceilings and original polished floor boards set the scene for this classic weatherboard home in Kooroocheang. Shadowed by the school building, this home is just 20 minutes from Daylesford and/or Creswick, in the gorgeous farming community, with sweeping country side adding to its unique appeal and lifestyle.
Warmed by a freestanding combustion heater and providing an Early Kooka oven, this homely hub is bursting with character while offering a cosy place to entertain friends and family. One bedroom is available with a timber over mantel, while walls, floors, ceilings and doors celebrate the 1870s architecture in which the home was built.
The country style lounge with wood heater has large french style doors which open onto the rear private deck and enchanting view through the landscaped garden surrounds.
Pressed metal splash backs are combined with a double vintage concrete wash trough, a gorgeous peep window and a second toilet in the laundry, while the very generous and uplifted bathroom provides an original pedestal bath, double shower, vanity and handy inside toilet. The bathroom can be easily converted back to 2nd bedroom and bathroom incorporated in the laundry.
The separate school is in original condition and lends itself to further development to incorporate into the house as extra living or bedroom space. The old blackboards and school cupboards remain a feature as does the high hall ceiling.
Entwined with vines and offering rambling organic gardens, this one acre property will encourage a weekend away, while delivering a toasty abode to raise a glass or two.
Connected to tank water and offering a brand new hot water service, this home with its quaint veranda is well positioned in the popular Daylesford district and offers a restful, charming home, filled with fascination and inspiration.
For further details regarding the original school house, please contact our agent today.","SOLD - $400,000","1

clunes-vic-3370,Blampied VIC 3364,"Magnificient 233 acres with stunning views
With highly productive soils and elevated sections providing sweeping views of rich volcanic plains and Hepburn Lagoon, this 233 acre property is simply stunning.
Superbly located with easy access and proximity to Ballarat (approx. 25 min) and Daylesford and Creswick (approx. 10-15 min), this property is currently a mixed farming/cattle operation but has the potential, with the addition of a dwelling at one of many potential sites, to be the ultimate lifestyle property.
This gently undulating country rises up the western side of Kangaroo Hills and has a solidly-based central laneway system which not only allows for convenient stock movement, but also has the potential to be developed into a driveway for a home site (STCA).
The property is divided into 10 main paddocks and 2 smaller holding paddocks; fencing is in excellent condition throughout and includes a network of electric fencing (energizer included).
There is an excellent water supply with four catchment dams and 2 bores. Water is gravity fed from a poly tank to a network of troughs. Power is connected directly beside a recently sunk bore which requires a pump and easy connection to the existing system of laid pipes (currently water is pumped through the system of pipes from a bore across the road).
The property has an excellent set of steel cattleyards (including a crush and loading ramp) and a serviceable 3 bay shed. It is very well sheltered courtesy of various plantations and shelterbelts.
