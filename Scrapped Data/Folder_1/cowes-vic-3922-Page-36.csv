cowes-vic-3922,6/2-4 Warley Avenue Cowes VIC 3922,"PENTHOUSE POSITION PERFECTION
This luxury Penthouse, with it's striking panoramic northern views of Westernport Bay, the Mornington Peninsula and French Island, is one of the finest 3 bedroom apartments in Cowes. It is perfectly situated high over and only 50 metres from the beach and within minutes of restaurants, shops and supermarkets.
The layout is open plan incorporating one entire floor of the complex and instantly impresses on entering with stunning views, light and spaciousness. The interior blends seamlessly with terraces all round and with the vast spatial stage that is the Cowes foreshore; the pier, the ferries, visiting ships, colourful yachts, the golden beaches, the dark silhouette of the pines and elms and the sidewalk cafes.
What distinguishes this property from others is the wide frontage and width of view from all parts of the living areas. Every room has a view and the panorama from the living areas is without comparison. High up over Westernport Bay the sun, the sea and the sky create an ever-changing theatrical stage, both by day and night, all year round. Large terraces allow for outdoor living like no other yet are still private and protected. All this and parking for 3 vehicles on title.
The spacious, tiled terraces with etched frameless glass balustrades are carefully arranged and located for morning and afternoon outdoor living and sun bathing. Floor to ceiling glass and generous sliding glass doors integrate the indoors with the terraces and bring the seaside ambiance right into every part of the apartment. The central Alpine Carousel “spinafire” with its swirling flames creates a cosy winter ambience while you are surrounded by that view.
Wide eaves provide covered outdoor protection and shield the glass from the summer sun while allowing warming sun in cooler months. Generous parking and a secure storeroom makes this property so unique and so versatile as a weekender or for permanent living. This is a low maintenance apartment designed for luxury living at its best.
Designed for and by the owner without compromise. The innovative design, quality low maintenance detailing, and first class construction were recognised by winning the Master Builders Association awards in 2007.","SOLD - $750,000","3
