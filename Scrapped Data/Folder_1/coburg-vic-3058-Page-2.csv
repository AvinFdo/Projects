Few studios beguile like this newly renovated two-bedroom ground floor Coburg apartment.
Beautifully positioned in a private street at the heart of Pentridge Village and its historic legacy, the apartments unique floor plan, meticulous design flourishes and fantastic inner-city location make this up-and-coming cultural hotspot an exceptional scoop for professional singles, couples and investors alike.
For starters, the residence is full of thoughtful touches. Think carpeted bedrooms with built-in robes and grandiose windows; laminate timber flooring in the living areas; sparkling stone benchtops and extensive gleaming white cabinetry forming the immaculate kitchen; and a quiet study nook, on the opposite side to the bedrooms to ensure work and rest are separate.
But its the soaring high ceilings and immense panoramic windows that truly set the scene. Bringing the outdoors indoors and bathing its interiors in waves of natural light, each instantly transforms what couldve been a standard run-of-the-mill apartment into a striking and palatial pad that surprises and delights.
Topping it all off is the apartments exquisite location. Just moments from Coburg Farmers Market, Pentridge Cellars and the Glass Den cafe, and within walking distance of the Merri Creek parklands, Coburg Lake, public transport and Sydney Roads array of shops, cafes and restaurants, your every want or whim is within easy reach.","SOLD - $445,000","2

coburg-vic-3058,4/3 Wardens Walk Coburg VIC 3058,"A Premier Coburg Lifestyle Thats Anything But Generic
INSPECTIONS STRICTLY BY APPOINTMENT - CONTACT AGENT
Calling all future owner-occupiers and investors! Looking for a townhouse that goes beyond the generic tropes? This double-storey two-bedroom townhouse, with its exquisite heart-of-Coburg location and modern comforts and conveniences, ticks all the boxes.
Positioned on the first floor, with stunning views across Pentridge Village and towards the city, offers spacious open-plan design encompassing the lounge, kitchen and dining areas successfully ensures every alcove is filled with natural light. Evensofar as to have two yes, two sunlit balconies, as though almost daring you to contemplate the alternative: missing out on sunny alfresco feasts with family and friends or the ease with which youd meander from the lounge to balcony for a nightcap with stars.
Beyond the kitchen, where those feasts will be whipped up via modern appliances and exemplary benchtops, is a large, light-filled bedroom. With its ensuite, sizeable built-in robes and abundance of space (theres enough room to pop a desk or reading chair) youd be forgiven for thinking this is the master bedroom.
Slip upstairs and on the landing youll find a bright, cosy study nook (complete with a gorgeous glimpse of the city skyline) and the real master bedroom.
Uniquely shaped and wonderfully spacious, this room earns its master title by way of its walk-in robe, ensuite, lounge retreat and yet another balcony. Its almost too easy to imagine cold winter mornings snuggled up with a book and a coffee in your private snuggery, or whiling away a lazy afternoon with a charcuterie board for two and a bottle of wine from Pentridge Cellars (just down the laneway) on the balcony as the sun sets.
Final amenities include dishwasher, ample laundry, split systems throughout, security intercom, secure remote-control access to a single-car garage (including storage) positioned directly beside communal internal entry.
The cherry on top is the apartments exceptional location. Situated along a private street in the heart of Pentridge Village and among its historic legacy, its walkability is top notch. Coburg Farmers Market, Merri Creek trails, Coburg Lake, public transport and Sydney Roads array of shops, cafes and restaurants are all just moments away. Whether its a night out on the town, a day at the park or a quick grocery run, everything you need is within easy reach.","SOLD - $600,000","2
