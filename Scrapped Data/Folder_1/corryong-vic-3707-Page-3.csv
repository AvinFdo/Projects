This once in a lifetime opportunity is available to those wanting their very own beautifully renovated church! If you have ever wanted a home that is something out of the ordinary, then look no further. Sitting on an easy to maintain half acre block of land in the middle of farmland the home is private and secluded.
Originally built in 1899 as a Presbyterian Church with the last service held in 1974, shortly afterwards it was sold and has since evolved into one of the most unique and beautiful homes.
Timber features throughout this character filled home, with a beautiful timber kitchen which has plenty of cupboard space and room for a large fridge, dishwasher, access through to the second living/dining/bedroom. The main living room features an amazing Nectre Mega wood fire providing ample heating and 2 air conditioners to cool the home in the warmer months, a mezzanine level holds the master bedroom, bathroom and toilet that looks out onto farmland and has a view that needs to be seen to be believed.
Beautiful views and a rural outlook everywhere you look whether you are standing inside or outside enjoying the peaceful surrounds of this charming home. Outside there is a large outdoor entertaining area with stencil concrete flooring and outdoor blinds to keep the weather at bay, there is an ample water supply available with 2 x 22,500L concrete water tanks, plus a bore which provides excellent additional water supply, large vegetable garden, herb garden, citrus trees, orchard, 2 KW solar system with 5 KW inverter. There is also a woodshed, with attached chook shed and dog pen.
Shedding on the half acre block includes a 4-bay garage with attached workshop as well as a second shed which features built in studio/office suitable for a beautician, massage therapist, hairdresser with reverse cycle air conditioner.
Taking in the views of the surrounding hills, which include Mount Mittamatite and Mount Kosciuszko, and only a short scenic drive some great freshwater fishing and water sport available in the Murray River, Cudgewa Creek and the Khancoban dam, not far to snowfields.
This could be your escape from the everyday living or your dream property but it's all here for you to move in, enjoy and put your own stamp on this opportunity.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"2
