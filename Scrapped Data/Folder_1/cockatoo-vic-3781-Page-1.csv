***AVAILABLE FOR VIEWING BY PRIVATE INSPECTION. CONTACT AARON DAY 0407 365 994 OR TYSON BLUHM 0437 843 820**
Thoughts of the Dandenong Ranges induce a flood of sensory information. You visualise giant green tree ferns and low clouds rolling over blue hills. You hear the laughter of the Kookaburras and the whistle of the iconic Puffing Billy as it trundles along the track. You smell the eucalyptus and crisp fresh air. You can almost taste the food from some of the regions award winning restaurants. And you think about mid-week breaks and weekend getaways.
This is your exclusive invitation to make these sensations part of your everyday life, with enough room for the extended family.
This dual accommodation estate is situated on 1 acre of meticulously maintained gardens and lawns between Cockatoo and Gembrook, along the Puffing Billy Railway line and with easy access to the Emerald - Gembrook Walking Trail.
The cottage has its own carport which has been thoughtfully divided from the main home by screening to ensure privacy. Just a few steps along a sealed path peppered by ornamental trees and shrubs, you reach the picturesque storybook cottage with covered veranda and gorgeous dormer windows. The interior of the cottage features a large lounge and dining area with cathedral ceilings, exposed beams and a gas log fire to cosy up next to, with all the ambiance of a wood fire without the hassle. The bright, functional kitchen features dishwasher, gas cooking and electric oven, and looks out over a private garden sitting area. There is an additional undercover entertaining area where you can enjoy a meal and wine outdoors when the weather is mild. The master suite features an ensuite with large sunken spa, the ultimate in relaxation in those cooler months. Upstairs are the two loft bedrooms, big enough to fit a double and a single bed, meaning the entire family can enjoy their own space. The cottage also features ducted heating and air conditioning for year round comfort.
The main home is a quality built solid brick home with a double carport at the entrance for convenience. The entry door is an oversized wood feature which produces an exciting impression of what lies behind it. Beautiful exposed brick walls and high cathedral ceilings with exposed beams and skylights provide a striking and light filled environment, consistent throughout the home. Immediately past the foyer is the large master suite with sitting room and ensuite with large spa, and a personal entrance through double sliding doors by a private courtyard. The windows here provide a unique aspect over the Puffing Billy Railway line.
Further into the home, off the wide hallway are 3 robed bedrooms serviced by a spacious bathroom. The hallway opens into the main living zone with dining area and commodious lounge with wood heater and windows that look out over the gardens and doors that provide access to the stunning inground pool, nestled aesthetically between the ferns.
Beyond, the main living zone features a well-appointed kitchen with double oven, cooktop and warming drawers and an informal dining area for serving up a quick bite. The laundry is also located here, in addition to the office or 5th bedroom.
Outside, there are undercover verandas on both sides of the home joined by a path that meanders easily through the gardens, designed to make the most of the natural surroundings and wildlife, while providing picturesque seating areas and maintaining privacy.
There is additional shedding with concrete floor and power and 2 garden sheds to house all the tools.
This property is currently known as The Whistle Stopover Bed and Breakfast, successfully trading in the region for many years due to its reputation for outstanding hospitality, pristine accommodations, and tranquil setting. It therefore provides a luxurious opportunity for 2 families to reside and contribute financially, or continue the Bed & Breakfast legacy.
This estate is nestled along the Puffing Billy Railway Line between the Gembrook and Cockatoo townships and is close to shops, public transport and the popular Emerald-Gembrook Walking Trail. It provides many possibilities for the discerning buyer so a viewing is essential.

cockatoo-vic-3781,5 Nangana Street Cockatoo VIC 3781,"Simply Stunning Seclusion
Chiselled onto this 3068m2 plot, with Cockatoo Creek meandering through the southern corner, is a double-storey family home built with limestone blocks that contain the luxurious living within. Homes of this calibre are few and far between. The thoughtfulness of layout, build quality and elegance of interior design are 5 Star and all within easy walking distance of local sporting grounds, school bus and public bus routes.
The gated entrance that brings you up to the house on a newly sealed driveway to the triple garage with dual access for boat or trailer. Internal access from the garage into a hobby room, gym or study and then into the tiled lobby with beautiful double front doors, impressive extra-wide staircase and powder room. From here you have a choice of living area - the formal lounge with gas log fireplace, the family living with meals adjacent to the kitchen or head upstairs to the den/rumpus or open-plan office. Fully tinted picture windows (partly double-glazed) look onto the outdoor living, landscaped bush garden or into the solar-heated in-ground lap swimming pool which can be accessed from the hobby-room, the kitchen, the formal dining, the laundry and downstairs shower room.
The upsized opulence of the master suite will leave you breathless. The bedroom is itself approx 5m x 5m plus a fully fitted walk-in robe (with access to even more attic storage) and the fully tiled ensuite complete with dual vanity, large shower and corner spa looking out to the tree-tops. The second bedroom is almost as impressive; semi-ensuite, mirrored built-in wardrobes and access to a balcony shared with the upstairs living zone. The main bathroom is also fully tiled with a corner bath/step-in shower. Two further great sized bedrooms along the corridor both with BIR.
The bespoke kitchen with Caesarstone benchtops and inbuilt wine storage, benchtop cooking looking out into the family meals space and heaps of storage that continues into the laundry that matches the kitchen cabinetry styling.
This is a very comfortable home to snuggle-up in winter or splash-out during the summer months. Supersoft carpet underfoot, evaporative cooling, ducted heating, gas log fire, block-out and shade blinds. And whether you are rugged up or swimming tog clad, there are so many places to have fun and entertain. The poolside outdoor alfresco, the deck and built-in seating around the firepit, undercover dining AND the most amazing cubby house adventure play area.
The landscaping is a beautiful balance between formality and native bush garden. There is a veggie patch ready for the green of thumb and numerous fruits including a kiwi vine, apple, pear, nectarine, plum, kaffir lime, lime and lemon trees.
