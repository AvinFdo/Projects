Quality drapes help insulate the rooms, while the neutral tones and existing cabinetry provide an easy foundation and palette to work with when decorating.
Two bedrooms offer built in robes, with a functional bathroom and independent laundry adding a serviceable floorplan for more than one. The kitchen offers a three point working station, while the defined dining area and living area all work well together. The rear yard could is nice and flat with a concrete path leading onto a little grassed area to rest in sun.
Finished with cosy carpet, vinyl flooring and feature tiles, this home provides retirees, first home buyers, investors or those looking to downsize an opportunity to live independently with little to worry about.
Connected to natural gas and offering NBN advantages ( back up battery), this property provides a lock up garage and extra car space, which certainly provides a tidy option if considering your next step in life.","SOLD - $225,000","2
