clifton-springs-vic-3222,1/6 Berrigan Street Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"DOWNSIZE TO BE CLOSE TO GOLF OR BOWLS
Looking to play a lot of Golf or Bowling and don't want too much to do at home? Well this unit might be the perfect downsizer for you to achieve your goal.
Or maybe you like the idea of buying an investment in an area where the prices have seen a great growth over the last 12 months of around 14.6% and you want to buy to be ahead of the future growth.
A short walk to the golf course or the bowling club means you can also fit in your exercise.
Never heard of Clifton Springs? A suburb that has taken a while to become known is now a suburb of choice for many offering all the amenities required for day to day living and playing.
Having lived here for over thirty years I have realised that even though it has grown it has not lost its historic appeal or peacefulness away from the hustle and bustle. You do not have to travel far to get groceries or visit the doctor or even ride your bike.","SOLD - $375,000","2
