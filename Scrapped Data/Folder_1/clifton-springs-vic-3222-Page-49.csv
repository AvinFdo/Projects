clifton-springs-vic-3222,28 Derribong Way Clifton Springs VIC 3222,""" LYNNWOOD"", Character & History
The home, originally built in Moorabool Street Geelong in 1882, was relocated to its present site in Clifton Springs in 2005. Some of the stand out features include 2 double sided chimneys rebuilt to original specifications and servicing the 4 bedrooms with four uniquely different fireplace surrounds, 11'ceilings, Original 1&1/4"" thick Baltic pine flooring throughout, and original doors and fittings. The curved kitchen bench built of cedar originally from the old Hamilton Hotel and antique french doors from Paris. The second building to the rear, built in the 1905 was originally the local chappel at Snake Valley servicing the Gold mining community of the time, with its stained glass windows and unique domed ceiling would make a fabulous home studio. It has been a labour of love by the present owner to bring these historic building back to their original glory. Modern features include: new plumbing, new wiring, new roofing and all council permits in place. Property is to be sold at Auction.","SOLD - $320,000","4
