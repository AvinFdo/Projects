You cannot get any closer to the waterâ??s edge at this address. A very sort after location where the views are different every day. One of the original homes on this strip, your morning coffee will be a great way to wake up overlooking Corio Bay with clear view of the You Yangs. Wonâ??t even need your binoculars to watch the ships, yachts and fishermen go by. This two storey home would work well as a holiday space away from the madding crowds or a permanent residence. The home offers open plan living downstairs and extra living and bedrooms upstairs. Massive games come party room across the back. Check out the floorplan and come see for yourself. Clifton Springs was established as a satellite city approx. 40 years ago but did not take off as planned. It is still a place that people do not realise is here unless you turn off the normal road. What it is about this place? It has everything you need to work, live and play. It is very quiet and itâ??s not far from Geelong, Melbourne or surrounds. The views will amaze you.","SOLD - $625,000","3
