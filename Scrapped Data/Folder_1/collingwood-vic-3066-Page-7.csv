collingwood-vic-3066,4 Budd Street Collingwood VIC 3066,"Victorian Residence with significant Development Prospects
The opportunities are almost endless with this comfortable double fronted home, offering so much romantic appeal.
The generous land and zoning will attract the attention of builders and developers alike.
This property has the option to have a multi residence set up, showcasing 3 kitchens, 3 bathrooms and 2 bedrooms with a second living zone or handy third bedroom/guest room.
Currently capitalising on the ever popular and attractive rental return of ""Airbnb"", with 2 smart self-contained abodes.
Featuring a spacious adjoining dining/living area, tranquil alfresco deck, just perfect for those mild spring time evenings and a huge backyard that is ripe for further development (STCA).
Retaining period features like open fire places, high ceilings, exposed brickwork and pressed metal ceilings, it would certainly be an easy restoration to its former residence.
Location is outstanding, with a central position close to vibrant Smith, Brunswick and Gertrude Streets.
Walk to some of Melbournes favourite restaurants, bars, cafes, art galleries and parkland.
Whether you occupy, invest, land bank, build or develop you will be richly rewarded with this one.
