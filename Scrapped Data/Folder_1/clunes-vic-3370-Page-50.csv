clunes-vic-3370,194 Smokeytown Road Springmount VIC 3364,"Contemporary Living on Approx. 2.8 Acres
Nestled at the bottom of Springmount, this ranch like home constructed with buttery sandstone blocks offers views, acreage and 21st living accommodation. Framed by the rolling hills of Springmount, this property offers majestic gums to the forefront and cleared acreage of approx. 2.8 acres.
A full width front veranda provides a shaded space along Smokeytown Road whilst the alfresco area (nearing completion) provides long distance views along with an ideal space to entertain guests and/or family. Approx. 23 squares, this three year old home provides a luxury master with ensuite and walk in robes, while floorplan versatility is offered via two further double rooms and a generous study, which could also be used as a fourth bedroom as it also has BIR'S. Each bedroom also contains a ceiling fan. A contemporary bathroom (with feature tiling) and independent laundry create excellent facilities to all the bedrooms while also providing amenities to the entire home.
Completely open in design, the French provincial kitchen is beautifully presented with wooden benchtops, high end appliances and a large walk in pantry that offers huge storage benefits for country living. Loads of windows and glass doors flood the room with light and warmth which add to the heat generated from freestanding wood heater in the dining and family room. A separate lounge also offers a further place to unwind or ideally located to adapt to a rumpus or games room.
Energy efficient via 20 solar panels producing 4.5kW, this additional feature provides massive savings on those dreaded electricity bills. Whilst the home does not present with an attached garage, there is a massive shed with high clearance for vehicles, boats and/or caravans. Landscaping has begun via retaining walls and flat lawn beds, yet there is the opportunity to begin some planting in and around the house and shed. Typically Australian, this welcoming home offers friendship to passing neighbours of kangaroos, wombats or eagles who bring further animation to this country homestead. Set just 5 minutes from the bustling little township of Creswick, this property also offers a 20 minute commute to Ballarat city via Midland Highway.
