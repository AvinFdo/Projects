cockatoo-vic-3781,7 Belgrave Avenue Cockatoo VIC 3781,"Rustic Charmer on 1 Acre Plus
Close to town, public transport and the local primary school, this characterful log cabin has everything that people move to the Hills for - peace, privacy & SPACE. An opportunity to update - have a google for ""log cabins painted black""!
Set on 4400sqm (approx.) and fully fenced, the block is alive with the sound of frogs coming from a large pond at the front entrance. There are many aspects to the garden including walkways, lots of beautiful planting (Victorian Christmas Bush, Weeping Acacias and Fruit Trees) large lawn spaces for the kids to play and a veggie garden.
A mass of wisteria greets you as you enter the large 4 space carport. This is a very serviceable area and includes an air-conditioned office and workshop converted from the double garage.
Step inside and you’ll find a perfectly presented and convenient home with an exceptional country kitchen. Cooking dinner at night is made easy with the size of the kitchen which also includes a built-in corner pantry, enough space for a double fridge, breakfast bar and an Ilve stove top.
There are 2 living areas - one that relates to the kitchen and another at an incredible size of 9x6m that comes with a quality 7' x 3.5' hydrolic pool table, that doubles as a dining table. Originally the space included a 4th bedroom so you could revert it to a 4th bedroom if that suits your growing family’s needs (STCA). Both lounge rooms offer wood fired heating – one is a large open fire and the other an old-school coonara style that can double as an open fire place.
All bedrooms are of good size with BIR’s and the master bedroom includes a “his and hers”.
And finally… after a long day’s work, you’ll enjoy nothing more than coming home to a glass of champagne and relaxing in the spa bath in the large main bathroom.

cockatoo-vic-3781,20 Maurice Street Cockatoo VIC 3781,"Good Vibes Await on 2057m2
This is a warm and cosy, semi-renovated, two-storey nest for you to put your finishing touches on. Set at the top end of Maurice Street accessed from Paternoster Road and with views to the north. Sold ""as is"" in a nearly finished condition with some plaster work, electrical & tiling still to be done. The work that is complete is of a really high standard - the kitchen, for example, uses some beautifully crafted wood for the benches and has a large 900mm stove cook top.
Upstairs, an open plan living looks out to greenery from every window including the study nook, with laundry, separate toilet and one bedroom. A spiral staircase takes you down to a second work space, main bathroom and bedroom. My thoughts are that an extension (STCA) might work down the track where the double carport currently is.
The outside spaces and gardens are just magical. A lush fernery with pathways can be enjoyed from the front porch. To the rear a deck leads to the veggie area and shed with a tree house/goat playpen and further garden shed beyond.
This is a very special place to be, so make sure you come and get a feel for it at the open for inspection.

For those who work from home there are 2 fantastic options, 1 a 3 roomed multipurpose studio built to high standards plus a single room studio or dedicated workshop, perfect for artists or hobby enthusiasts and both are completely independent of the main house for working uninterrupted. Add to this a lockable hay shed, horse shed and a self-filling water trough fed from tank water, mains water supplies the main house. For storage and vehicles there’s a triple bay garage, storage shed and the secret cellar completes everything you could possibly want or need. Inspect this unique property today and get a taste of what heaven must be like.
