clayton-south-vic-3169,2/45 Bevan Avenue Clayton South VIC 3169,"Move Straight In Its Virtually Brand New!
Ease of living in every single aspect is your reward for the astute purchase of this excellent Clayton South residence, with the Clayton Rd shopping strip, Westall Primary School, Westall train station and Keeley Park within walking distance and Monash University Clayton Campus, the Monash Freeway and the Dingley Bypass just moments away.
That essence of carefree living extends to the fashionably renovated interior of the two-bedroom single-level unit, which is one of only three on the block.
Boasting a new chic bathroom with a freestanding soaker bath, new gourmet kitchen, new timber and tiled flooring, renovated laundry with loads of storage space and plenty of natural light throughout, the home is virtually brand new so you can move straight in or lease it out with total confidence.
A sun-kissed living area delights with its generosity of space, as does the separate open-plan kitchen/meals arrangement.
Both bedrooms enjoy the convenience of built-in robes, while reverse-cycle split-system heating/cooling and block-out blinds throughout add further appeal.
A smart investment, downsizing or first home option, this as a new residence is evidently packed with value and opportunity!

clayton-south-vic-3169,125 Bourke Road Clayton South VIC 3169,"A PRISTINE 3 BEDROOM HOME PLUS WORK FROM HOME SALON
In simply stunning condition, it is quite clear that the owners have been here for a long time – 32 years in fact! During that time they have loved and cared for the home in impressive fashion with a host of recent updates making it look and feel like new. Fronted by a crisp rendered façade with roller shutters on the front windows and a long driveway leading to the carport and the garage converted into a full hair and beauty salon. Inside, the home features light paint tones and porcelain tiles throughout that enhance features including a lounge/dining room, a meals area and a beautifully renovated kitchen with stone benches, a wall oven and electric cook top. There are 3 bedrooms with split system air conditioners including 2 with built in wardrobes and an updated bathroom with separate toilet. Ducted heating is also included and outside there's a grass free north-facing yard with a covered patio spanning the back of the home as well as fertile vegie patches, a shed and workshop/storage room. Just down the road from the Clarinda Shopping Centre, the home is also within walking distance of buses and Clayton South Primary School with central Clayton just minutes further. .","SOLD - $820,000","3

clayton-south-vic-3169,1/45 Bevan Avenue Clayton South VIC 3169,"A Solid Investment Or Great Place To Start
A premier investment, great first home or downsizing opportunity defines this conveniently located single-level, two-bedroom unit that's within quick and easy reach of Clayton's bustling hub.
Walking distance access to the Clayton Rd shopping strip, Westall Primary School, Westall train station and Keeley Park combined with its close proximity to Monash University Clayton Campus, the Monash Freeway and the Dingley Bypass has future-proof investment written all over it, while its low maintenance layout and positioning in an established residential block (it's the front unit of only three on the block!) will appeal to empty nesters and young couples alike.
Clever zoning is a hallmark of the light and bright floorplan, which sees two bedrooms with built-in robes positioned away from the central living area.
A perfectly serviceable kitchen with loads of storage space combines with the meals area to create a sizeable dining set-up, while a light-filled living area with split-system heating/cooling, polished timber floorboards, low maintenance courtyard, bright bathroom (with shower and bath), large laundry and a single garage add further appeal to this excellent find.
