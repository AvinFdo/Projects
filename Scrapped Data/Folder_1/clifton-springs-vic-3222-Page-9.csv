Huge block, luxury home, private beach, spectacular views.
Here's a truly rare opportunity to own a unique piece of Clifton Springs' real estate endowed with a massive landscaped garden, an impeccably-presented brick home, a panoramic view of the bay with the You Yangs as a backdrop, and your own absolute beach front.

The double block presents a long, tree-lined drive (Golden Elms, Japanese Maple, Manchurian Pear) to the ample parking courtyard and double garage. A paved path flanked by exotic garden beds leads to the impressive front portico, with leadlight windows surrounding the front door. Once inside, you're naturally drawn, via a welcoming lounge, to the breathtaking view of the bay - which is on display across the whole of the north-facing, open-plan living area.
A decorative fernery with its own watering system is a special feature at the eastern end of the room, and an intimate dining alcove sits in a central bay-window - taking in the superb coastal vista. The generous kitchen has a return bench with a 40mm Caesarstone top, an Electrolux wall oven, grill, and induction cooktop, an Asko dishwasher, and a walk-in pantry. A second lounge/entertainment area opens to the covered front terrace which is equipped with automatically retractable see-through blinds and an adjustable louvred roof - just the spot for a relaxed alfresco meal.
The master bedroom has a walk-through robe to a neat ensuite, while two more bedrooms have easy access to a main bathroom and powder room. There's also an office, a well-equipped laundry, an outdoor WC, a practice putting green, and even an entertainment gazebo at the edge of the expansive front lawn. Year-round comfort is provided by electric under-floor heating, split systems and ceiling fans throughout the home. In addition, and in close proximity to the house, is a large storage shed and workshop - big enough to take a boat and trailer, a ride-on mower, and more. Here, a superb lifestyle awaits - or the chance to subdivide and develop.
