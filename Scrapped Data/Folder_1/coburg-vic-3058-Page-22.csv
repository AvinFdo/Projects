coburg-vic-3058,64 Queen Street Coburg VIC 3058,"Timeless Charm, Coburg Convenience
Irresistible charm and a coveted Coburg location combine to deliver a family home that's certain to generate wide appeal.
With St Fidelis and Coburg West primary schools a short walk from the front door, the location is ideal for the growing family or the young couple with an eye on the future. Factor in the swift access to the No.58 tram, Moreland train station, the popular Sydney Road shopping and dining strip, Citylink and scenic parkland and it's understandable why this location also represents a solid blue-chip investment.
Polished timber floorboards flow beneath the towering high ceilings that are gifts of a bygone era, while zoned living sees three generous-sized bedrooms (master with period fireplace) and a bright family bathroom secluded from the central open-plan living/dining area and large updated kitchen equipped with generous bench space and a 600mm upright cooker.
Presented in pristine condition, there's scope to further enhance the interior with a modern touch, while the blank canvas nature of the low-maintenance backyard will also encourage you to create something special.
Featuring rear lane access, gas heating, split-system heating/cooling and a large shed with kitchenette and laundry, make your presence felt in desirable Coburg.","SOLD - $836,000","3

coburg-vic-3058,20/3 Wardens Walk Coburg VIC 3058,"Walk on the Wild Side
Find your place in Pentridge Village with this exceptional two bedroom residence and you'll be thrilled with the layout and unusually spacious design both inside and out. Flowing from the kitchen to dining and living areas, the home continues to a huge covered terrace - an absolute game changer for entertainers - below which is a courtyard area also well suited to alfresco dining. A glass-ceramic cooktop, fan forced oven and great storage, including a large pantry, go even further in making a case for inviting everyone over on weekends and holidays. Each of the two double bedrooms is linked to its own bathroom by a walk-through robe (one bathroom is a discreet ensuite and the other offers dual access points), and the main bedroom comes with direct terrace access. There's also a full laundry, plus heating and cooling, security is as strong as you'd hope with a remote controlled gate and building entrance with intercom, and there's a covered car space with storage on title. A stroll to Lake Reserve, Sydney Road trams and the shops, cafes and bars of central Coburg feel free to enjoy a fantastic lifestyle.","SOLD - $510,000","2
