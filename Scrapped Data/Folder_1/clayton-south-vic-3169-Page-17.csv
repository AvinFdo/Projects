clayton-south-vic-3169,2/4 Burns Avenue Clayton South VIC 3169,"Convenient Location!
Detached, space, style and single-level living combine in perfect harmony to offer a stylish low maintenance home thats tailor made for first homebuyers and astute investors.
Those looking for a passive investment opportunity will be buoyed by its updated nature and immense rental potential, while homebuyers wishing to call this place home will be impressed by its contemporary appeal and homely character.
Neat and tidy, it has everything you want and needs a minimum of fuss. All two bedrooms are big, bright. The modern family bathroom features a bath, shower and a separate laundry room, while a contemporary kitchen is sure to please with its maximum (and intelligent) use of space, ample, great floor plan. The low maintenance backyard achieved a flowing sense of space. 10 solar panels on the roof provide energy for a 3.5kw inverter to save your electricity bill.

clayton-south-vic-3169,1/25 Rayhur Street Clayton South VIC 3169,"CLASSIC STYLE & MODERN CONVENIENCE IN ONE PACKAGE - UNDER CONTRACT
If you want the convenience and easy lifestyle offers by a unit but find that many modern units a bit bland and lacking character, then this warm and inviting street front weatherboard home on a subdivided block might be ideal. Less than 10 minutes walk from train stations and central Clayton's facilities, a great position is only the beginning. Fronted by a steel fence and its timeless façade, this home features high ceilings, a central hallway, a generous lounge room and a meals area adjoining the pristine kitchen with corner pantry and stainless appliances including an oven and cook top. There are 2 large bedrooms including one with built in wardrobe and the other with an ensuite to match the family bathroom and second toilet. Ducted heating and a split system air conditioner take care of the comfort and outside the front courtyard is completely usable and out the back there's a grass free courtyard with covered patio and gate access to the rear set double carport. Freshly painted, immaculately presented, this home is ready for you to move in.

clayton-south-vic-3169,12 Bond Street Clayton South VIC 3169,"A CLASSIC 3 BEDROOM WEATHERBOARD HOME IN GREAT CONDITION
Everyone loves the timeless look of a weatherboard home, and this example, on approximately 610sqm has been beautifully maintained throughout its life and offers its new owner the chance to either rent it out as it stands, move in and be instantly comfortable, or explore its potential for redevelopment as either a luxurious new home or 2 units (STCA).
Its yellow painted façade and mature trees in the front garden give it distinct appeal while inside you find polished hardwood floors and 9ft ceilings throughout much of the home. Features include a formal lounge with gas heater, a large kitchen with upright oven/stove and a living area that steps out to the covered deck.
There are 3 bedrooms that all feature built in wardrobes as well as a family bathroom, separate toilet and a big laundry. Outside, the backyard is spacious and car lovers will certainly appreciate the oversized carport and the tandem garage that could double as a workshop. Backing onto the impressive Namatjira Park the home is also close to buses, 2 primary schools and is just minutes away from central Clayton and its buses, trains, shops and medical district.","SOLD - $850,000","3
