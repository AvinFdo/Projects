clifton-hill-vic-3068,30 Dally Street CLIFTON HILL VIC 3068,"SO LIGHT, SO WELCOMING!
A meticulous renovation designed to maximise light and space gives this free-standing Edwardian residence the winning edge. On the high side of a picturesque street of well-maintained houses, its picket fence and fretwork-trimmed verandah provide immediate street appeal. The hallway is the first of several surprises – floored in gleaming Baltic pine, with newly-restored plaster cornice work and arch, it has been given highset windows to admit year-round light. Looking down over the street, the spacious main bedroom has a full wall of custom-built wardrobes and plantation shutters. The second and third bedrooms also have built-in wardrobes; one has French doors to the paved area to the side, and access to a vast part-floored attic storage area.
To the right of the hallway, a new fully-tiled bathroom extends into the side light court. The fine proportions of the new rear section of the house are enhanced by a high gabled ceiling; here, a superbly equipped kitchen, with Bosch appliances, Caesarstone and stainless steel benchtops and extensive storage, overlooks the living and dining area, which flows through a wall of multifold doors to the paved north-facing courtyard with ROW car access. A pair of heirloom silky-oak doors opens to the side. Off the living area are a full-size laundry and separate powder room. Featuring fine period detail, ducted heating and split-system airconditioning, this appealing property is close to Clifton Hill Village, schools, transport and Yarra parklands. You won’t be disappointed!

clifton-hill-vic-3068,12 North Terrace Clifton Hill VIC 3068,"Wellington House Circe 1883
This majestic property was built by former Acting Premier of Victoria George David Langridge, a man who forged a career in Victorian politics and championed the cause of the working classes having started as a carpenter and trying his luck in the goldfields.
In 1923 the property became a convent to the Sisters of Charity with a foundation stone commemorating its opening by Archbishop Mannix.
This faded gem is in need of substantial renovation and refurbishment to restore it to its former lustrous glory with its grand entry to two spectacularly large interconnecting drawing rooms that once would have seen grand balls.
Upstairs has seven rooms plus a bathroom built over the driveway and a 2nd maids stair to the kitchen, with four large rooms downstairs. There is a coachman’s cottage/stable at the rear and a sumptuous quantity of land to the house’s east.
Sitting on approximately 18,000sq.ft (1670m2) directly opposite Darling Gardens with commanding views across the treetops to the city skyline this home will again become a showpiece in the area.
NOTE: On auction day property will be open from 10:20am and close pormptly at 10:50am allowing 10 minutes to clear property prior to auction.","SOLD - $4,115,000","5

clifton-hill-vic-3068,5/79 Heidelberg Road Clifton Hill VIC 3068,"More affordable than you’d think…
Located on the upper floor of this select block of only 6 apartments is one of the more affordable 2 bedroom apartments that you’ll find in this delightful inner city suburb. Fronting Fenwick Street with its majestic Plane Trees providing a pleasant outlook this apartment is currently leased until January 2011 and would make an ideal ongoing investment or first home.
Although comfortable as is, the apartment is currently a little tired and would benefit from a cosmetic refurbishment to enhance its sizeable floor plan which offers built in robes in each of the 2 bedrooms, updated kitchen/meals, spacious lounge, tiled bathroom with laundry facilities and separate toilet. Features include security entry, off street car space on title and of course an envied location walking distance to the delights of the Clifton Hill Village, Queens Parade, Yarra Parklands and a host of public transport options.","SOLD - $407,500","2

clifton-hill-vic-3068,11 Page Street CLIFTON HILL VIC 3068,"INNER CITY SUCCESS MADE SIMPLE
Totally transformed and stylishly extended rather than merely renovated, this exceptional inner city home delivers three bedrooms and two bathrooms in addition to a cool, contemporary living/dining domain with a desirable indoor-outdoor emphasis.
A quiet, convenient non-thoroughfare adjacent to Darling Gardens and Clifton Hill Primary School provides the perfect context for instant enjoyment and offers easy access to the CBD as well as Queens Parade cafes and Fitzroy's eclectic shopping
An allotment slightly wider than usual for the inner city complements the pleasing first impressions created by a pretty period facade.
Immediately, a welcoming hall with Tasmanian Myrtle floors establishes a stylish tone for two downstairs double bedrooms sharing a sky-lit contemporary bathroom. Upstairs the main bedroom is accompanied by walk-in robes and en suite and takes in some inner city lights, including those of the MCG
The inviting living/dining domain opens to dual decks and an elegantly efficient courtyard while an open-plan kitchen is equipped with stone surfaces and an island bench.
The decks, one facing east, the other south, enhance entertaining options and precede an attractively maintained courtyard that concludes with a right of way that would facilitate off street parking if so desired.
Central heating, refrigerated cooling, under-floor heating in bathrooms, smart wiring for data, TV and cable add further lustre to a polished inner city performance!
