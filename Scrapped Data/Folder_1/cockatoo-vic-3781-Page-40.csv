cockatoo-vic-3781,155 Mountain Road Cockatoo VIC 3781,"6 Acres-Suite horses, and 2 Houses!
Lots of options here, Rolling grassland, well fenced for horses or similar, delightful location, beautiful garden. Close to the Cockatoo Montessori school. The main house is a 3 bedroom brick veneer with en suite bathroom, and the character filled mud brick cottage is quite separate and self contained. There is a double garage in brick to match the house and a paved outdoor area. The road access is very easy and the northern aspect gives great light and panoramic and uninterrupted views of the Yarra Valley Ranges. This would be a great place to call home or an excellent rental return with the two individual dwellings easily lettable.

Magnificently set on almost an acre of stunning land, this residence surpasses all expectations. From the moment you drive in, the home captivates with wall to wall windows and an impressive second level balcony that fills you with anticipation.
Double red doors form a unique entry into the first level of the home where you are instantly drawn to the chimney inset wood heater in the spacious formal lounge with exposed brick walls and polished floorboards. Perfect for entertaining, the dining area separates the lounge from the kitchen which has a 900mm cooktop and oven and unique triangular island bench that provides plenty of room to cook up a storm.
For comfort and convenience there is also a powder room and separate toilet on this level.
Tucked neatly behind the chimney is a lovely staircase leading up to the second level of the home where the wooden balustrade compliments the exposed brick and feature shingle wall, creating a distinctive and warming character.
Here you will find the second living area with access to the balcony that has the most pleasant views over the front yard and into the golf course beyond.
There are also 4 good sized bedrooms, the master equipped with ensuite and walk in robe. The remaining bedrooms are all robed and serviced by a tastefully renovated bathroom.
The laundry on this level is on the far side of a large tiled sunroom with ducted heating, making it the perfect place to dry the washing during the cooler months. During the warmer months this drying room has direct access outside, and due to the extraordinary undulation of the land there are no stairs to descend.
This rear yard is terraced and only inclines either side of the home so that the front and rear yards are almost flat. Furthermore, thoughtful construction allows for vehicular access to the rear.
The sealed driveway from the street meanders through gardens peppered with ornamental trees and wildlife attracting shrubs before arriving at the triple carport in front of the large double lock up garage with internal access to the home.
The distinctive features of this home make it aesthetically pleasing, spacious and contented while still capturing the essence of warmth and relaxation.
Calming views and quiet, convenient location make this property a must see!

If you are looking for a quiet, tranquil home to come back to after a busy day, this inviting 3-bedroom, 2 bathroom brick veneer home, on a no through road, is looking for a new owner. Set on an acre of land with its own woodland and bird attracting fauna this property is sure to rejuvenate your love of nature and the outdoors.

The interior of the home is set up well for growing families and the custom designed Tassie Oak cabinetry in the kitchen is beautifully finished and with a separate grill, wall oven, cook tops and dishwasher is set up ready and waiting for the next budding chef.
THE WOW FACTOR:
The rear huge decking has been built to last with all metal construction except the timber flooring which is protected from the elements and it is sure to be a favourite spot for entertainers all year round, it affords a tree top outlook with views to a dam in the distance.
ADDED EXTRAS:
This AV Jennings home was built in 1990 and has concrete stumps and brick piers, insulation in the walls and ceiling. All the windows are lockable and have flyscreens. External doors have security doors.
Each bedroom has a split system for heating and cooling. There is a wood fire in the family room and split system in the lounge. A 6x9 meter garage is also an excellent bonus.

cockatoo-vic-3781,14 Dunstan Road Avonsleigh VIC 3782,"Dream Starter!
Every now and then you come across a house that really feels like home. And this is it.
This home sits proudly on a generous 1/4 acre in the natural Avonsleigh surrounds with views into the hills of Wright's forest.
The front of the home features a generous veranda where you can sit and listen to the sounds of wildlife in the sunshine over your morning coffee.
The double colonial style sliding front doors welcome you into the light filled home with comfortable carpeted lounge room and neutral colour scheme. Beyond the lounge is a functional kitchen with plenty of bench space and adjoining dining area with windows that let the light in and provide views over the rear yard and into the distance.
The bedrooms, 2 with built in robes, are located along the hallway and serviced by the large main bathroom. The laundry is cleverly tucked away behind double doors in a contemporary European style.
There is also a study with stunning views that will inspire you to work or study hard to be your best, without the stress.
From the study is an exit that takes you onto a spacious covered timber deck with bistro blinds; the perfect place for entertaining with family and friends, watching the little ones play or just watching the continuous display of life thriving everywhere in such a majestic place.
The land is punctuated with tree ferns and native shrubs to encourage wildlife, and a healthy, maintained gum tree in the middle of the rear yard that is the envy of the town.
The home also features gas ducted heating, air conditioner, single lock up garage, single carport and garden shed.
Everything about this house feels like a home. Don't miss the opportunity to view.
