connewarre-vic-3227,11 Glendale Drive Leopold VIC 3224,"Space, Style And Central Location
An impressive outdoor entertaining zone, bright open-plan living, exceptionally stylish bathrooms and high quality finishings are some of the many highlights of this 3-bedroom family home set on a surprisingly large block in the heart of Leopold. Tucked away in a peaceful neighbourhood, it's within walking distance to sporting facilities, the bustling Gateway Plaza and serene Gateway Sanctuary, and just moments from Leopold Primary School and childcare options.
Bright and open, the main dining and living space is welcoming and sophisticated and comes with hardy, scratch-proof timber laminate flooring. The home's contemporary kitchen offers beautiful grey Caesarstone benchtops with a striking dark-coloured splashback, Technika oven/cooktop and Westinghouse dishwasher, and a fantastic Butler's pantry. The generous master suite has a WIR and modern ensuite featuring a walk-in shower, floor-to-ceiling light grey tiling, a black hexagonal-tile splashback and trendy matte black tapware. The bathroom with bath, vanity and separate WC shares the same stylish aesthetic, and services the minor bedrooms, each with triple BIRs and plush carpets. Ducted heating, a Fujitsu split system and ceiling fans take care of climate control, and push-button light switches throughout add extra class.
The spectacular undercover outdoor entertaining area can be fully-enclosed using state-of-the-art Ziptrak blinds, significantly extending the home's floor plan. Outdoor heaters maintain comfort on even the coldest nights, and extensive in-built cabinetry is ideal for housing the BBQ and bar fridge. The low-maintenance rear yard is spacious, with plenty of room for the kids and pets to roam; it has a garden shed, and a border of ornamental pear trees which provide a thick green privacy screen over summer, and let sunshine flood through during winter months.
Extras include an oversized DLUG, solar hot water, an integrated watering system and European laundry. This home has it all: space, style and a fantastic central location. Contact Liam for an inspection today.
