clunes-vic-3370,15 Bath Street CLUNES VIC 3370,"Snapshot of Yesteryear in Clunes
Rarely do opportunities, so rich in history, come about. Owned and occupied by the notable Lean family, this 1863 property will be marketed for sale. An astonishing 73 years of residency, this charming cottage endured the nurturing of eleven children.
With some original period features still in place; combustion oven & timber lined walls - this home is completely unique.
Set on a slightly sloping allotment and nestled amid the relics of yesteryear, this amazing feature filled' home has been reenergised to provide a modern twist to centuries of living. This typical miner's cottage has been restumped and rewired to provide a solid base, whilst the interior has had some work completed with the installation of a stunning Bellings induction stove, gas hot water and ample cupboard space; however there are still renovations to complete by the new owner. Whilst the laundry is currently housed within the family bathroom, this could be returned to its external shell with a little work, to provide further space inside and capture the original larder style laundry.
Fuelled by a cosy free standing wood heater plus benefitting from the convenience of a split system, this property of 1315m2 provides plenty of space and sheds to manage a large woodheap and tools for winter provisions. Drenched in abundance of times gone by', this property would create a quirky weekender or a quaint family home. Located within walking distance of the main street of Clunes and close to the local school, shops and public transport, this heritage listed property is a unique purchase.
