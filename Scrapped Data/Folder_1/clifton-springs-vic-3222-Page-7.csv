A timber kitchen is simply charming and serves up a practical space; expansive bench tops, excellent storage solutions and quality fixtures
A stunning formal lounge of grand proportions boasts a northerly aspect; dual bay windows promote wonderful natural light and prime outlook over established gardens
The second living area is expansive; glass sliding door step out onto a decked entertaining space; a lovely place to take in an early coffee whilst bathed in sunshine
This home is fully equipped for those who love to entertain; a purpose built and sheltered area to the rear of the residence
The oversized garage spans 8.8m x 7.8m approx and serves up a myriad of options but just wait there is more; under-house storage as far as the eye can see gives further scope and options if you desire
