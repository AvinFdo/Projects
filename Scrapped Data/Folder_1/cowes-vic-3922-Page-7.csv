cowes-vic-3922,11 Walpole Street Cowes VIC 3922,"A Piece Of Phillip Island's History
Nestled to the rear of this 1,000m2 (approx) parcel of premium land, located mere meters from the north-facing Cowes foreshore, is a charming circa 1880 Victorian era brick residence with a rich history.
Behind the heritage listed facade is a character filled home that offers four generous bedrooms and two living areas with soaring ceilings, and stunning period features like impressively large skirting boards that are typical of the era but rarely seen in modern homes. Combine this with multiple fireplaces and a balance of timber and paved brick floors, and you have a truly rare opportunity to retain the historic beauty of the home while adding some modern and personal touches.
Located in the heart of Cowes, this blue chip property is a gentle stroll from Thompson Avenue cafes, restaurants and boutique shopping. Added convenience comes from being close to medical and educational precincts, and the Cowes Yacht Club and jetty are within walking distance.
Treasured by the same family for over 80 years, an opportunity like this must be seized. Phone today to arrange your private inspection.
