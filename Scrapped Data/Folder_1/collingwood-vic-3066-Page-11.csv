collingwood-vic-3066,104/55 Islington Street Collingwood VIC 3066,"Quality Exudes from The Modest Industrial Entry Onwards…
Within the historic Silo Apartments where four cylindrical concrete towers mark the central focus of the development and situated in the still industrial sector of Collingwood, you’ll enter through a large copperised swing door to the central forecourt with BBQ area and a number of relaxation spots. This first floor apartment has a spacious one bedroom design with larger than usual balcony and a fully blown kitchen instead of the tiny kitchenette’s in most apartments. Overlooking Islington St its private enough but encapsulates the inner city hub of activity.
Security entry, single car stacker, storage cage and long standing lessee make this an ideal investment, or for the owner occupier we’ll have to give our lessee the bad news and find them a new home such is their cailbre.","SOLD - $425,000","1
