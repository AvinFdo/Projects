Perfectly positioned only a stones throw from the bushland along the Murray River and along the much sought after Bisogni Drive, this 3 bedroom plus study home is not going to be on the market all that long! Everything about this perfectly presented home is big! The stunning timber kitchen with its stone benchtops has the most cupboards and benchspace in any home on the market at the moment. With all the usual mod cons such as electric wall oven, ceramic cooktop and dishwasher this kitchen also has most of the cupboards fitted with drawers to maximise the use of storage. This home has potentially three living spaces but at the very least offers two generous sized spaces. The master bedroom is positioned at the front of the home and comprises large WIR and Ensuite with double sized shower. The other bedrooms are located adjacent the family bathroom and laundry. Externally this home has an outdoor entertaining area and double garage with direct access into the home. For the caravan, boat or any other large toy, the driveway offers a parking bay area for those too! If you think this home might be for you, call now for an inspection.
