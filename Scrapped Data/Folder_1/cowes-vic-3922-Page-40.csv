cowes-vic-3922,29 Helen Street Cowes VIC 3922,"UNIQUE ENTERTAINER
Situated at the end of a quiet court, with an easy 10 min walk to beach and boat ramp and just a 2min drive to the main Street of Cowes. This much loved two storey/open plan home features light-filled spacious living areas. The award winning indigenous garden provides not only privacy from the road but is a haven for native birds. It also provides a shady place to relax on those hot summer days. A fully fenced property makes this an animal-friendly space.
The home takes advantage of a passive solar design, with louvre windows throughout providing cross-ventilation. The house is supplied by both rainwater tank and mains. The solar hot water system is a welcome bonus! The clever design means that the winter sun is fully embraced, but the summer sun is kept from directly hitting the windows and the double insulation takes care of the rest.
An entertainers delight, the large kitchen can accommodate many cooks at one time with ample bench space and plenty of room to move, the dining area can be extended by throwing open the French doors to the front deck, perfect for those summer barbeques and parties.
The large laundry has plenty of storage space and leads through to the rear garden where you can take advantage of the existing raised garden beds to grow your own fruit, vegetables and herbs. There is even a small chicken coop for those who love the idea of collecting your own eggs for your morning breakfast.
New bamboo flooring throughout the lounge area and a large wall of windows that really let the outside in, make it a lovely space in which to relax. And for the movie buffs, there is plenty of room for that big lounge suite and entertainment system.
On the second level, the king sized master bedroom boasts two private decks, built in robes and a sumptuous two person spa, making it a bedroom to truly ‘retreat’ to. Separated by a shared en-suite, the delightful king sized second bedroom can accommodate guests/extended family with ease.
This home exudes character and is refreshingly different from the rest. It has been regretfully offered up for sale and current owners are confident that the new owner will love this home as much as they do.
