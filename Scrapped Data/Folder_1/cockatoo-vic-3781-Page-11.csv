cockatoo-vic-3781,157 Rainy Hill Road Cockatoo VIC 3781,"""Lyric"" - Welcome Home
The feeling you get from the moment you step into this property is that of entering an enchanted world. The home is steeped in history being an original cypress pine clad workers cottage with a 2 storey brick addition. Surrounded by mature gardens that ooze nonchalance belying the years of hard work that has gone into their creation.
As you wander around the house and pathways “outdoor rooms” are revealed where you can while away the hours with a book or do a bit of bird-spotting from the deck. The game of hide and seek can be taken to the next level in this garden. Planting includes at least 30 camellias, dogwoods, banksia roses, lilac, citrus, apple & plum trees. Plus a sunny veggie garden. One of the two carports doubles as a support for the glorious wisteria.
Before we enter the main home take a moment to think about how you will use the separate “tiny home” - it could be the best Wendy house ever or even an income producing Air B&B. One more outbuilding - and that is the work shed for all your tinkering & projects.
And finally, step through the impressive double front doors into the large and airy entrance hall. Ascend the staircase to find a large rumpus or library space with office and covered balcony. The master bedroom with its own balcony too, entered via the spacious walk through robe, ensuite with double shower and separate toilet.
Downstairs, three further bedrooms all with BIR’s and delightful views of the greenery outside. The main bathroom has a spa bath and double sinks. The kitchen looks out onto a large deck perfect for lunch and evening BBQ’s. The meals area opens into the family room with a bar area. There is a separate formal dining room with butlers pantry which would also work as a playroom or downstairs study. A central double sided wood-fired coonara is the hero here and links the family area with the more formal lounge with vaulted ceiling.
Not only is there a Harry Potter cupboard under the stairs but this home also has a cellar - accessed from a trapdoor in the hallway and also from outside. A cool store to keep all your bottles of wine, beer & pickles!
This is an incredibly lovely family home. Solidly built and with plenty of mod-cons including a multitude of power points throughout and on the decks. GDH & reversible fans. Town Water & Water Tanks.
Hurry to inspect your little bit of paradise.","SOLD - $715,000","4

cockatoo-vic-3781,40 Rainy Hill Road Cockatoo VIC 3781,"Contemporary Victorian Homestead With Unrivalled Views
The residence is positioned towards the rear of the property and accessed by a long driveway affording views along its entire length until it slowly appears into view, secluded amongst established gardens and shade trees, offering absolute privacy.
This is a contemporary Victorian weatherboard with all the embellishments of the era and with every up to the minute comfort, innovation and convenience.
There are broad return timber decked verandahs offering numerous vantage points from which to enjoy the panoramic views, with almost all rooms from the residence enjoying French door access to take full advantage of this wonderful amenity.
Constructed with best of materials and completed with a critical eye to detail, the residence has a feeling of solid dependability while imparting a truly calming energy. This is a home built for maximum enjoyment. The ability to segue sophistication with a casual ambience is a tightrope walk but the owners have managed to achieve that grand task – a real credit to them both.
With the classic grand proportions of each room, wide corridors, high ceilings, ornamental cornices, quality timber joinery, polished timber flooring, banks of timber framed windows, brick hearth and feature French doors and broad verandahs, right down to the authentic brick pattern of the chimney stack, this is a Victorian homestead of the landed gentry! The modern-day requirements of electric heating and cooling, solid fuel heating (to both formal and informal living areas), secret plumbing to wet areas, stone benchtops, stainless steel appliances, oversized showers, Sok bath, modular wardrobes and full insulation makes this a very pleasant and comfortable home indeed.
Offering four bedrooms, all with those perfect views, the main bedroom with a luxurious ensuite bathroom, study/home office, Chef’s kitchen and informal dining, family bathroom, two grand living areas, formal entry and vestibule, outside powder room plus spacious laundry and walk in linen/ utility room. A broad timber decked outdoor living area overlooks neatly tended gardens planted sympathetically to the era, one area leading through a Wisteria covered archway to a full size (mod- grass) tennis court.
A timber Victorian style barn, concrete floored and powered offers both car accommodation and workshop space. With the classic front awning in place all that is missing is a hitching rail and horse trough! Adjacent is an original timber shed which has been renovated to two large stables with vertical hardwood lining boards. There is also a four bay steel machinery / hay shed of the modern era. Water security is assured with 100,000 litres of fresh water storage and two dams, one of which provides pumped pressure switch fed water to the gardens and stock troughs. The property comprises of 34 acres, offering an idyllic mix of gently sloping to moderately steep pastures and native hardwood bushland alive with flights of native birdlife who are regular visitors. There are seven paddocks for choice of livestock and good shelter for the greater comfort of stock. Conveniently located for access to both Melbourne and the delights of the Yarra Valley, the property affords a sophisticated yet casual rural lifestyle.
