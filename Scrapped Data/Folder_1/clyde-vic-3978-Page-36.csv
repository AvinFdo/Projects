clyde-vic-3978,35 Carr Boyd Road Cranbourne South VIC 3977,"PARADISE AWAITS!
Whether you are looking for space for trucks & machinery or to accommodate your four legged family or both - you can do it all here at 35 Carr-Boyd Road, Cranbourne South.
The modern home (approx. 50 squares) was built in 2008 with family comfort in mind comprising 5 great sized bedrooms plus study (6th bedroom), 3 genuinely separate living areas plus a private retreat to the master bedroom. As you enter the home the widened hallway draws you through to the large open plan kitchen/ living and dining area all enjoying fabulous views over the dam out to the gently undulating land beyond which is raised & highly suited to horses with large shade tree and even the makings of a Menage.
The master bedroom is well separated with it's own external door to the verandah and is complete with walk in robe and dual vanity ensuite.
At the other end of the home you will find 4 further genuine double bedrooms off the large retreat/rumpus room with access to it's own alfresco and serviced by a central cleverly designed powder room and family bathroom. The home theatre is well positioned away from the bedrooms opposite the enormous study/home office.
The 2nd - yes 2nd alfresco is accessed from the dining area overlooking the solar heated swimming pool with built in spa providing the perfect spot for entertaining family and friends.
The house is certainly going to tick the boxes but it doesn't stop there - what's on the rest of the land is just as impressive.
Shed:
Now, this is not just a shed this is the shed to impress - 3 bay American barn that is double ended - from the driveway it's the perfect home for vehicles/boats/caravans/trucks while the rear section is accessed from the land side and would make the perfect tack/feed room with a mezzanine structure which can be finished to store anything you need. The concrete floor and additional side driveway concrete area will handle trucks & machinery without issue.
The Land:
Behind the picturesque dam is one large paddock that could easily be split into two with dual gates already in place and a Menage which will need resurfacing however there's even easy drive up access to this area to take the hard work out of that.
