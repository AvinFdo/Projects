Cockatoo
Cockatoo is a town in Victoria, 48 km south-east of Melbourne's central business district. Its local government area is the Shire of Cardinia. Cockatoo is named after Cockatoo Creek, which runs through the town, and which the town was previously named.
Cockatoo's small commercial centre is located along a steep section of McBride Street and includes a small supermarket and a selection of cafes and other places to eat. The Puffing Billy tourist railway line crosses right next to the shops at the base of McBride Street, recreating those days of stream train travel from long ago as it regularly passes through the town centre.
Cockatoo has a good selection of sporting facilities. In the town centre along the west side of Pakenham Road is a bowling club, basketball courts, tennis courts and other recreational facilities. The Cockatoo Sports Complex is located in Mountain Road and consists of an indoor stadium, oval, athletics track and netball courts.
