On the upper level of this modern complex of only 14 dwellings, built over two levels this two bedroom apartment has all the right attributes for a home or sound investment.

The main level is all open spacious living with full width floor to ceiling glass to a great barbecuing or casual beverage balcony with a larger than normal kitchen including large walk in pantry plus a powder room. Featuring a light neutral decor, reverse cycle air conditioning, security entry, storage cage and wait for it ... 2 adjoining car spaces
