Spanning the entire 5th-floor of the historic Yorkshire Brewery tower c1876, this brilliant apartment conversion presents a landmark lifestyle opportunity with 360-degree views. Once a beacon for colonial Melburnians and the largest of its kind in Victoria, the architecturally significant brew tower with its evocative French Second Empire mansard roof has undergone a total renovation (it's now even earthquake proof!) and reveals a first-time offered opportunity with this superbly-crafted contemporary apartment. Lift access to the exclusive 5th-floor precedes a perfectly-designed, practical interior instilled with outstanding modern style and superior-quality features and finishes while retaining its rich original spirit with high 3.8m ceilings, thick exposed brick walls and double-glazed arched windows. Adjoining a covered alfresco terrace, the open-plan living and dining area incorporates a stunning Miele-equipped marble kitchen leading to 2 sizable bedrooms with built-in robes, beautiful bathroom and a laundry. There's also linear ducted heating/cooling, video intercom, wool carpets, dark oak floors plus on-title basement car space and private storage cage. The rejuvenated brewery precinct is bubbling with life and located close to Gertrude and Smith Streets' shops and eateries, trams, Fitzroy Gardens, East Melbourne hospitals, MCG and the city.","SOLD - $975,000","2
