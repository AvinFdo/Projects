cranbourne-vic-3977,5A Barilla Court Cranbourne VIC 3977,"**SOLD BY PAUL RINGERI**
CRANBOURNE: **NO BODY CORPORATE FEES APPLICABLE / ALL DAMAGED FENCING WILL BE FIXED UPON SETTLEMENT**
With its quiet court position, the added privacy of being the 2nd unit on a block of only 2 and with easy access to every amenity you could possibly require this unit is a must to inspect!
Presented in A1 condition the property itself has been very well maintained over the years, is full of natural light and is nestled on a sensational parcel of land. With a northerly aspect the block measures a healthy app. 409m2 and is surely of the major selling attractions!
Perfectly suited to owner occupiers and investors, the home features a central hallway that leads to the open plan living/dining area complete with gas heating. The pristine kitchen features an upright oven/stove.
There are 2 robed bedrooms that both offer built in wardrobes, the master also has ensuite style access to the dual entry family bathroom with separate toilet.
Step outside and be greeted by a private driveway that leads to the single carport.
If you believe in the age old theory that good real estate revolves around a central location then you won't be disappointed! Within moments of the shopping facilities situated at the recently revamped Cranbourne Park shopping centre you also have easy access to South Gippsland Highway. Those that don't drive can take full advantage of the public transport leading to the main street and, most importantly, the Cranbourne train station. You are also only a brisk walk from Cranbourne Park primary school and local parkland!
This is bound to walk out the door so don't delay!
