clifton-hill-vic-3068,157 Roseneath Street CLIFTON HILL VIC 3068,"The Trojan Horse
Things are not always as they first appear: and so it goes with this traditional family home on a ultra-wide land allotment (270 sqm approx.) overlooking the beautiful streets of old Clifton Hill. A residence held dear to a single family for generations, it now returns to market offering its fortunate new owner incredible potential on luxuriously large land. What will you discover hidden behind its vanilla brickwork facade and decorative lacework?
Featuring the immediately recognisable 'northside' floorplan typical of this quaint pocket of Melbourne, the home enjoys lofty grand-height ceilings throughout and delightful art deco flourishes including delicate ceiling plasterwork, ornate fireplaces and fretwork. Take your pick from two living zones: a space best described as the 'good lounge' - a comforting room with space to welcome and reward your friends and family around a grand dining table, and a cosy family/dining room for casual meals, warming up by the heater and catching up on TV favorites. The spotless retro kitchen comes direct from Melbourne circa 1970s, with meander pattern floors, long aluminium double sink and solid Westinghouse gas cooker. Both bedrooms are extraordinarily large with peaceful neighbourhood vistas, and are accommodated by a simple bathroom with bath/shower combination in a vintage pink.
Begin your own family tradition by taking a seat under the broad, shady front porch in the calm hours before dusk, watching the neighbourhood return from a day's work. To the rear of the home, a leafy tree surveys the generous yard replete with ROW parking, exterior storage shed and laundry. Positioned ideally, you're but a stroll to the Ramsden Street Reserve and the bushland setting of the Merri Creek Trail which leads to the Fairfield Boathouse - and only minutes from Clifton Hill Station, the Darling Gardens and the shopping and cafe culture of Queens Parade and High Street Northcote.
More than meets the eye, indeed.

A Commanding Victorian Terrace with Appeal and Potential
Situated in an elevated position in this coveted wide street adjacent expansive parklands this very comfortable terrace has a typical floor plan immediately livable but presenting with so much more potential. The side hall gives access to two generous bedrooms, then whilst unusual the floor plan works well with entry to a well equipped modern kitchen before opening to two adjoining rooms that serve as a dining and lounge room.
The bathroom and laundry are positioned to the rear and the house exudes warmth and character and can be let or occupied as is, or for those with a keen eye to further capital value there’s a generous rear northerly yard with car access. The allotment is sizeable and the potential to undertake extensions, perhaps adding a second level make this a very desirable property.","SOLD - $985,000","2
