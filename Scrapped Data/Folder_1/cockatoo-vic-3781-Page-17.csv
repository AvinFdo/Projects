cockatoo-vic-3781,751 Woori Yallock Road Cockatoo VIC 3781,"Magnificent
This is a once in a life time opportunity to buy the home of your dreams. This magnificent American Ranch style home is reminiscent of the television show Dallas with the impressive stone entrance and automatic gates opening onto the newly concreted driveway which winds down stone edged manicured garden beds to the circular driveway complete with 3 tiered fountain. The home's facade gives a hint of whats behind but once inside you will be enamored with the grand proportions. Step inside and you'll be greeted with the gorgeous entertainers kitchen with granite featured on all the bench tops (including the butlers pantry), there is stunning cabinetry with glass display cupboards, huge 1200mm stainless oven with gas cooktop and for convenience the kitchen is accessed from the double garage (with remote doors), so you will never be caught in the rain. Opposite the kitchen is the dining room with glamorous chandelier, then the theatre room or perhaps a formal lounge.
The grand staircase is located in the middle of the home with the stairs stretching out to both sides of the bedroom level. As you would expect the Master has a large walk in robe and ensuite with double vanity and spa bath, the further 4 bedrooms are large and all have built in robes. Back downstairs you'll find open plan living cleverly designed with a wall dividing the games room from the family room which has a stunning stone feature wall with ambient wood heater for wintery nights. This area has towering pitched ceilings with timber beams for a rustic lodge feel and leads out to the wrap around timber deck. Add to this a Bar Room complete with plumbing and powder room. From here you'll find the study/home office with external access and there's also a cellar for all your expensive wines or treasures!
No expense has been spared with fixtures and fittings and features including spotted gum & iron-bark floors, double glazed windows, hydronic gas heating, split system cooling and ducted vacuum.
Outside the grand proportions continue with the huge (25x10) shed incorporating a 1 bedroom loft style apartment, perfect for extended family/visitors or perhaps a work from home studio. Add to this an enormous barn/wood shed with enough wood storage to keep you going for many cold winters, 100,000 litres of water, fenced paddocks if you have horses, a dam filed with water lilies with a decked bridge and rotunda, which is a peaceful place to relax and watch the gorgeous sunsets.
This is truly an amazing property and will be the envy of all your friends. Words are not enough to do this property justice organise your private inspection today!
