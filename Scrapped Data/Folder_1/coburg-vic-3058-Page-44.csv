coburg-vic-3058,1/14 Woolacott Street Coburg VIC 3058,"A Sanctuary in the heart of Coburg
Mere steps to the cafes, restaurants and shops that make Sydney Rd such a sought-after destination the scale and style that define this townhouse residence brilliantly accentuate its individuality, a trait additionally enhanced by its street frontage. Double robes and ensuite privacy to the downstairs master bedroom precede open plan living where entertaining possibilities are eagerly anticipated. Integrated Smeg appliances and stone surfaces exemplify kitchen quality, while the option to enjoy meals alfresco is a welcome accompaniment - and undeniably attractive owing to the lush climbing jasmine that surrounds the decked courtyard. Upstairs bedrooms bask in the natural light captured by sky windows crowning dramatic vaulted ceilings. Private balcony to front bedroom, polished hardwood floors, ample storage and the convenience of car port plus extra off street parking. Moments to any form of transport including tram or train.","SOLD - $830,000","3
