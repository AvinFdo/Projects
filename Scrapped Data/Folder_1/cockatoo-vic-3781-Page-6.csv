Million Dollar Views on Paternoster
Spectacular views to Westernport & Port Phillip Bay to the front and bushland views from the backyard of this neat brick home built circa 1996. There's tailor-made parking for the caravan, large driveway, double garage with remote doors direct interior access, rear access for trailers, a workshop shed, wood storage, chicken coop and the pièce de résistance...a large covered entertaining deck surrounded by a bed of camellias and a weeping mulberry tree. The block feels so much more expansive than just three quarters of an acre.
Inside, the split-level home has 3 good size bedrooms and a 4th, that shares access to the master ensuite and could also be used as a study with an exterior door to the garden. The front lounge has a bay window with bay views! The kitchen is entirely serviceable but would enjoy an update and looks over the sunken family/rumpus with wood-fired coonara.
The location could not be better, set back on the prestigious (sealed) Paternoster Road allowing quick passage to Pakenham, Berwick & local townships of Emerald & Cockatoo.
This one will fly!

A boutique build with a floor plan that has been carefully considered to provide the most generous 35 squares (approx.) of family living plus alfresco, veranda and front porch.

A wide light-filled stairwell with walk-in storage space under-stairs leads up to a study zone on the landing and a huge rumpus or family living area occupies the front. All additional generous sized bedrooms have hidden walk-in robes with one of the bedrooms upstairs also featuring an ensuite. The main bathroom has bath, shower & double vanity.
There has been no compromise on the quality of feature items such as cornice & skirting, the workmanship is faultless. Nothing is standard. Everything has been done with the look, convenience & comfort in mind.
