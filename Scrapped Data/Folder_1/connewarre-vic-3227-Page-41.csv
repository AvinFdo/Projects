connewarre-vic-3227,59 Stoneleigh Crescent Highton VIC 3216,"Homeschooling haven!
Whether youre homeschooling, working from home or god forbid - both - wouldnt you rather do it somewhere that provides plenty of space for all, and a great yard to boot the kids out to when you need a sanity break!?
The hero of this property is without a doubt the huge flat backyard, pool and spa, great entertaining spaces (ok, maybe not for a little while!) and ridiculous amount of storage space. Theres even side gate access so you can tuck the van or boat away, and another car space up next to the oversized double garage. Absolutely perfect for anyone with a trade related business.
Your master suite is cleverly positioned on the main level, well clear of the kids zone downstairs. The open plan kitchen/dining/living is just sensational, with multiple bifold doors spreading out onto the large deck. Overlooking the pool and backyard, youll also come to enjoy the beautiful sunsets from this magnificent westerly aspect.
A separate study will assist with the working from home setup and keep books and computers off the dining table - well, thats the idea anyway!
Ready now for you to move in and enjoy, call David to organise your private inspection.","SOLD - $1,012,000","4
