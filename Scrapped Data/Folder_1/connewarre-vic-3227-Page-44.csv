The second you set your eyes on this home, you will truly be in awe. Exposed bluestone bricks, timber lined ceilings and slate flooring are just some of the elements that piece together this majestic work of art, oozing rare character and warmth that is just not found anymore. High ceilings and split level design combined with the views of the reserve, exude a grand sense of space and ambience. This property offers three generous sized bedrooms with built in robes, master suite with its own ensuite, study & sunken lounge overlooking the beautiful & tranquil Pepperdine Park. All bedrooms are serviced by the central bathroom, including the fourth bedroom/rumpus room.
Flooded with natural light, the kitchen is perfected with Merbau bench tops & Tasmanian oak cabinets with views to the reserve. Leading off the spacious lounge, the undercover alfresco is the ideal spot for entertaining or enjoying your morning cuppa. With direct access from the gorgeous rear garden out onto the reserve, taking your four legged friends for a walk has never been easier. French doors feature throughout, along with a split system and gas log fireplace in the living, plus a 5kw solar panel system, powering the entire property.
With the ability to close off the second half of the house off in the hallway, privacy that teenagers, parents or Airbnb guests fancy is proven. The opportunity to create a timeless Airbnb retreat using the third and fourth bedroom, bathroom and laundry, is possible and has been done successfully in the past.
In the heart of leafy Highton and just moments from the adored community in the Highton Village, quality schooling of all ages, Waurn Ponds shopping mecca, Epworth Hospital and the Ring Road taking commuters to Melbourne in under an hour.
