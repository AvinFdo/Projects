clifton-springs-vic-3222,34 Yarramundi Drive Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"ROLL YOUR SLEEVES UP AND GET DIRTY
One of the original homes in Clifton Springs that was designed to enjoy the views from the front porch. The warmth of timber floors and large windows letting the light in are lovely features which make you feel right at home as soon as you walk in. Be warned this is a ""big project"" home.
In a suburb that is yet to reach its peak, where you can achieve a lot of house for your money. It's a great time to buy before the prices increase as these homes will be harder to come by. With a bit of time and money this home could be restored to its former glory. Are you up to the challenge?","SOLD - $279,000","2

clifton-springs-vic-3222,32 Panoramic Terrace Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"Luxurious townhouse with uninterrupted panoramic vistas.
There is no wondering why this sumptuous residence bucks convention and reserves its lower level for luxuriously appointed sleeping quarters. Though beautiful bay views are available from downstairs, it is the upper level that grants undisputed proof of accuracy for the name of this street.
Uninterrupted panoramic vistas across Port Phillip Bay to the You Yang mountains and the metropolitan night-scape are absolutely breathtaking! From your lofty vantage point above the treetops, see ships and yachts sail past whist you spend lazy days lounging on a balcony that represents the pinnacle of outdoor living.
Alternatively, catch the gentle sea breeze in the study or vast open plan family room, never tiring of the sensational scenery of this optimal northerly aspect. Daydream at the dining table, watching skies occasionally dotted with distant planes on course to unknown destinations.
Even cooks will enjoy their daily toil all the more with another fine expanse of horizon at the kitchen window. Here you can also keep an eye on kids playing in a backyard below that is filled with a feast to harvest, from fruit trees to herbs and vegetables.
This surprising space grows olives, peaches apricots, nectarines, lemon, lime, chilli, garlic, strawberries, pumpkin, sage, basil, mint and more! Tiered and beautifully landscaped both front and rear, leaving no lawns to mow, the new residents can simply relax and reap the rewards of this deliciously productive garden.
Opulently appointed throughout, inclusions encompass stainless steel Bosch appliances, bamboo flooring plus copious cabinetry such as pot-drawers and twin pull-out pantries. A large storeroom lined with shelving, under-stair storage and direct access to a garage that has an automated timber panel lift door add the lengthy list of features. Walk-in showers to both the en suite and bathroom plus reverse cycle heating and cooling are also found here.
Walking distance to supermarkets, school, restaurants, golf course and ample local amenities makes the quick 21 kilometre trip into Geelong almost obsolete. An abundance of Bellarine beaches, wineries, cafes and so much more simply equates to a decadently restful existence at this exceptional address.
- Panoramic bay, mountain & metro views from deluxe indoor & outdoor living zones
- Filled with natural light from north-facing timber-framed windows and sliding doors
