Whoever said you couldnt have nature on your doorstep and the convenience of an easy commute to the city in Melbournes inner suburbs hadnt heard of this beautifully placed three-bedroom town residence in Coburg.
The crown of the court, this double-storey home offers privacy, secure entry and a wonderful dose of leafy tranquility on the cusp of Merri Creek and its lush parklands and walking trails.
Once inside, the bright and airy interiors ensure the serenity of the great outdoors never feels far away. From the open-plan lounge and dining area that spills out onto an alfresco concrete patio, to the two front bedrooms overlooking the verdant parklands, the floorplan makes the most of inviting in natures own. The master bedroom, even while tucked away at the back with walk-in robe and ensuite, still enjoys an abundance of sunlight.
Its the internal entry from the double-car garage,though, that might actually be the most interesting part of all. The double-car garage (attic) is accessible through a secure remote-controlled gate and once youve parked, youll make your way through the alfresco patio to the house via two large glass sliding doors a seemingly unremarkable yet clever addition to the garage that offers the opportunity to extend your entertainment space for those big milestone events.
The kitchen, positioned between the dining and patio areas, is primed to take advantage of this. Ample cupboard space, stainless steel appliances and a five-burner cooktop ensure whether youre preparing for an intimate dinner party or throwing a big birthday bash, youre in prime position to dish up the goods.
Additional amenities such as storage cupboards, split system heating and cooling, powder room and European laundry are dotted throughout the house.
The Manna Gum complex also offers a secure gated entry, as well as a large pool and BBQ area.
Close to Sydney Roads shops, cafes, restaurants, Coburg Farmers Market, public transport and, of course, the local parklands, this home is a stellar offering that promises the best of both worlds.","SOLD - $700,000","3
