collingwood-vic-3066,60 Keele Street COLLINGWOOD VIC 3066,"SUBLIMELY SUCCESSFUL WAREHOUSE CONVERSION
A conversion that reveals distinctive designer flair and fabulous attention to detail has created a light-filled contemporary residence of huge appeal framed by former factory lines that ensure total privacy.
Enhanced by preferred northerly aspects, complemented by convenient double garage, this superb modern home casts a discreet impression from the outside before revealing spectacular spaces within.
Huge living/dining areas have their already impressive dimensions enhanced by soaring double ceilings and an accompanying courtyard that cleverly fulfils an additional role as an effective atrium.
The sublime upstairs main bedroom features a sunny terrace overlooking the elegant courtyard and is further complemented by walk-in robes and a lavish en suite.
Second upstairs bedroom, third downstairs and second bathroom provide outstanding accommodation.
Great granite and smeg kitchen with walk-in pantry and cafe windows onto the courtyard caters with elegant efficiency and completes a stunning set of inner city spaces.
Ample storage, reverse cycle heating/cooling, gas fire place, intercom entry and video security put fine finishing touches to the ideal example of property that has evolved 'from factory to fabulous'!
