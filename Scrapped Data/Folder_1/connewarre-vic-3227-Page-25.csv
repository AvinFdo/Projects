State Government now permitting public OFI's for groups of 20 people, social distancing still applies.
We regret that residents from Metropolitan Melbourne or Mitchell Shire must not attend an open for inspection at this stage. Please contact the agent to organise a virtual inspection.
We are all looking for a quiet life at the moment and what better than a court location. Close to all major amenities in Leopold including all you need to work, rest and play.
Lounge, Kitchen, meals and main bedroom overlook north facing U-shaped decking. Winter warmth through the expansive glass windows, clerestory windows and doors.
