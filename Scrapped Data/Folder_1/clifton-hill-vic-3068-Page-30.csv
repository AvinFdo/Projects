clifton-hill-vic-3068,1 Caroline Street CLIFTON HILL VIC 3068,"A STATEMENT OF ARCHITECTURAL EXCELLENCE
Featured in a recent issue of Inside Out, this refined residence has been completely rebuilt within its block-fronted Edwardian shell by architect and designer owners Michael and Jodie Branov of Branov Design. The result is a building of considerable distinction, thoughtfully configured for a low-maintenance family lifestyle close to Clifton Hill Village and Yarra Parklands. This is a house which creates a sense of understated drama, as one carefully- zoned space folds out to another. Entry from the wide front garden, planted with heat tolerant species, is to a broad high-ceilinged hallway, from which open an impressive living room with period fireplace, two large bedrooms with quality built-in storage, and a sensational Carrara marble-tiled bathroom, with free-standing sculpted bath, shower and louvred glass to a planted light court. The main bedroom adjoins an ensuite bathroom flooded with light from a second internal courtyard garden. Extensive storage here is crafted from oiled recycled blackbutt, used to striking effect throughout the house. Past a full-size laundry linked to the main bathroom, the house opens out to a spectacular Great Room living and dining zone with shard ceiling window and a study at one end of the kitchen, which is superbly equipped with integrated Miele appliances, a butlers pantry, and black-matt 2PAC joinery. A wall of glass flows out to a terrace and courtyard, overlooking the lawned back garden and a stylish covered parking area and studio/storage space.
Exceptional design features include burnished concrete and Bremworth carpet floor finishes, commercial grade cooling and heating with brushed metal diffusers, double-glazed windows, Rogersellers bathroom detail, and a 5000 litre underground grey water system.","SOLD - $2,040,000","3
