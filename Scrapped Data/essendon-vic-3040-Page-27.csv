essendon-vic-3040,6 Forbes Street Essendon VIC 3040,"Stunning family home in an exclusive neighbourhood!
Phone enquiry code for this property: 8018
From the outside, this is a luxurious French Provincial-style home exuding elegance. Inside, the home is every bit contemporary, comfortable and finished to only the highest standards.
An expansive, two-level floorplan is spacious and flexible, offering plenty of room for a growing family.
The upper-level houses six bedrooms including the grand master suite with walk-through robe, attached study, luxe dressing room and stunning ensuite. A retreat space leads to four guest bedrooms, all with robes, double glazed windows, shutters, roller blinds and either a private ensuite or access to a Jack-and-Jill bathroom. Two bedrooms also open out to a balcony with views over the backyard.
The lower level is home to the main living spaces, all designed to make the most of the enviable indoor/outdoor lifestyle. Sliding doors feature in both the living and dining spaces, opening out to beautifully landscaped areas including the poolside alfresco area designed for hosting the ultimate summer party or watching the footy on the weekend.
A gourmet kitchen with a suite of Smeg appliances, stone benchtops and adjoining butlerâ€™s pantry overlooks the open-plan living spaces and out to the yard, so you can watch the kids play in the cubby house while whipping up dinner.
When itâ€™s time to relax, there is also a theatre room and a formal lounge with motorised blinds. The sixth bedroom with built-in robe and ensuite bath is also housed on this level. A large laundry with powder room, an abundance of storage and a double garage with drive-through and workbench complete the floorplan.
With this stunning home, you will want for nothing. The property boasts an impressive list of extra features including a 5kW solar system with German Samboy inverter, a ducted vacuum system, a split system in the lounge, master and guest bedroom, plus a security system with CCTV. Previously loved as a home-base for off-road adventures, thereâ€™s space to park a campervan and the trailer can be a great bonus package if you love to explore the great outdoors.
This dream home is set on a spacious 726sqm block in an exclusive Essendon neighbourhood close to prestigious schools and within walking distance of the train and tram stations. A host of cafes and major shopping centers are close-by, along with the lush surrounds of Queens Park. The home also boasts stunning city views so you can watch the New Yearâ€™s Eve fireworks from the comfort of your home.
