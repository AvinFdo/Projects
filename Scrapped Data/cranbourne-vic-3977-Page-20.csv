cranbourne-vic-3977,64 Circle Drive North Cranbourne VIC 3977,"**VENDOR MEETS THE MARKET** WHEN LOCATION, AFFORDABILITY & POTENTIAL COUNT - OVER 600M2 OF PRIME LAND!
CRANBOURNE - Positioned in a quiet back street location it's hard to believe this budget buster is still set within minutes of everything that Cranbourne has to offer. If you need easy access to parkland, train stations, buses, local schools and Cranbourne Park shopping centre then 64 Circle Drive North needs to be added to your inspection list!
Set on a fully fenced block measuring around 604m2 the property itself is extremely private and features an abundance of space and plenty of scope for further improvements down the line. Price to sell this is the perfect opportunity for first timers, investors and those looking to land bank. If you are a keen developer there is sufficient evidence in the area of subdivision making this the ideal unit site (S.T.C.A.). With hectic lifestyles the norm these days there is bound to be high demand for modern, low maintenance units should you decide to demolish and reconstruct!
Inside you will find a character rich home with exposed beams, timber flooring, a spacious lounge/dining area, separate family room and a timeless timber kitchen complete with stainless appliances plus an open laundry allocation.
There are 3 bedrooms including a rear set master that includes a walk-in wardrobe and a semi-ensuite to complement the family bathroom and separate second toilet.
2 gas heaters and a split system air-conditioner ensure year-round comfort, whilst outside there's a fully usable old school front yard and a North facing backyard with a deck for entertaining. Don't forget the spacious 2.5 car garage/workshop, whilst the gated driveway is a bonus for those requiring additional parking space for work or recreational vehicles!
If you believe in the age-old theory that good real estate revolves around a central location then you won't be disappointed. With easy access to freeways and Eastlink, you are never going to be too far away from your next day out in the city!
