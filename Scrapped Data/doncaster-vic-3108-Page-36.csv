doncaster-vic-3108,4 Robin Court Doncaster VIC 3108,"Luxury family living in leafy Doncaster.
Sale By Set Date Tuesday 12th June at 6.00pm
Ideally situated in a quiet cul-de-sac in leafy Doncaster is this grandiose home offering luxury living on a spectacular scale. This decadent family living is bolstered by proximity to key amenities including Westfield Doncaster, Doncaster Secondary College and public transport options. Perhaps the most impressive aspect here is the capacity for entertaining.
Young eyes will light up at the sight of the waterslide cascading into the pool, while the spacious undercover barbecue area will keep the adults happy year round. Quality shines through in the kitchen with a full Miele suite, including induction stove, oven/steamer, second oven and warming drawer. The butler's pantry is an added convenience, and there is an abundance of storage throughout the house. In the same zone as the kitchen is the main dining space which is bathed in natural light.
The main downstairs living area is compounded by the more formal, carpeted lounge in a separate wing of the home. There is also an upstairs studio providing large families with flexibility. Upstairs are four bedrooms, each with built-in robes and an ensuite in the master plus another bathroom with a double vanity. Additional benefits include the huge three-car garage plus a workstation, evaporative cooling, ducted heating and the property's own weather station.","SOLD - $2,000,000","5

doncaster-vic-3108,13 Philip Avenue Doncaster VIC 3108,"A modern showpiece of a superior standard.
Secure your place in one of Doncaster's premier locations with this brand new, ultra-contemporary glamour.
An easy walk to Macedon Square shops and cafes, city-bound bus services, Manningham Medical Centre and Timber Ridge Reserve, locations in which to start a new chapter of family living seldom come any better. And when you factor in the close proximity of Westfield Shoppingtown, St Gregory The Great Primary School and the Eastern Freeway, you can appreciate why this location is held in such high demand.
Boasting no common land and no Body Corporate fees, this modern marvel strikes a stylish pose with its chic façade before opening onto a striking entrance hallway, which employs width, height and length to great effect.
A brilliant open-plan living zone seamlessly connects the fashionable interior with the all-seasons alfresco deck, where a built-in gas mains BBQ caters for casual get-togethers any time of year and a landscaped rear yard is a picture of perfection and is low in maintenance.
Back inside, a waterfall stone island bench combines with a 900mm freestanding stainless steel cooker, glass splashback, sleek cabinetry and a fantastic walk-in pantry to create a dream kitchen for the home cook, while soft cushion-like carpets in all four bedrooms and the versatile retreat upstairs provides a luxurious touch.
Two master bedroom options (one zoned downstairs; both with a walk-in robe and fully-tiled ensuite) gives you plenty of options, while two additional robed bedrooms enjoy the privacy of the upstairs floorplan.
Showcasing excellence in craftsmanship and superior finishes, this feature-packed home also boasts warm timber floors, square-set high ceilings, video intercom, study nook, alarm, remote double garage with internal access, ducted vacuum, refrigerated cooling and ducted heating and a sleek laundry.
It's the height of executive family living in Doncaster.","SOLD - $1,555,000","4

As you'd expect, functional and practical living forms the cornerstone of this low maintenance family haven, showcasing breathtaking architectural elements unique to itself and treasured by anyone who's lucky enough to call this place home.
Presented with a captivating entrance with glass lobby, it's a bold first impression that successfully evokes the language of 1970s houses and sets the tone for the level of architectural innovation inside this sun-kissed home.
A vast open-plan living area with an open fireplace greets your arrival beyond the front door, where a new pelmet that runs along the perimeter of the interior strikes a crisp line against the rough texture of the exposed brick walls. Large windows, which includes a generous corner window with a day-bed, filters abundant natural light into the home whilst also strengthening its connection with the landscaped exterior.
Stunning raked ceilings with exposed timber beams accentuate height and space throughout, while a bright central meals/kitchen area enjoys the lifestyle advantage of accessing the home's two contemporary outdoor entertaining areas - one of which links with the private saltwater-chlorinated swimming pool.
Marvel at the spacious character of the rear family living, fitted with a built-in desk and shelving for the home office worker or studious pupil, and admire the successful separation between the master bedroom (full-length built in robes and bright ensuite) and four children's bedrooms, which are serviced by a contemporary family bathroom.
Featuring hydronic heating and generous off-street parking, this architectural icon also boasts a five-star address that's within walking distance of Macedon Square shops, bus transport, Manningham Medical Centre, local schools and Westfield Shoppingtown.","SOLD - $1,335,000","5
