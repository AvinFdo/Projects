Kaye Charles Real Estate are proud to present to market for our motivated vendor one of the region's most remarkable equine Estates - ""Westernport"", a tailored 97 acres approx. with the title fronting waterline and ornamental lake. Located within minutes to Pakenham Park Racing Precinct (convenient for horse enthusiasts).
Offering views of Western Port Bay is this near new, Victorian inspired, 6 star mini mansion, designed and built by the award winning ""Harkaway Homes."" The 2 story residence, with full verandas and balcony commands the highest level of grandeur whilst providing an irreplaceable living environment of rare sophistication and opulence. All principal rooms are positioned to take in the magnificent horizon, made even more dramatic through double glazed, full length windows, capturing the view and an abundance of light.
The 53 sq. floor plan is as sophisticated as it is practical, designed to accommodate 2 families with 5 bedrooms, offering the perfect balance of formal and casual living. The lower Level offers a more casual setting with fully equipped kitchen complete with walk in pantry, incorporating family room with separate, formal lounge, powder room, 2 bedrooms and bathroom. The lift, or stairs lead to the 2nd level, offering a more elevated level of luxury. The designer, stone kitchen with Falcon cooking and butler's pantry is the focal point of the home, overlooking spacious living room with gas log fire. Cafe doors fold open to the magnificent Coolgardie indoor/outdoor entertaining room complete with built in BBQ and wok burner set in a stone bench top, with separate bar, all making for a serene, relaxed setting. The parent's retreat is a plush space that enjoys full ensuite and walk in robes. Indoors has been appointed with every conceivable luxury from hard wood, polished floor boards throughout, 3 fully tiled, travertine bathrooms with stone bench tops, 4 toilets, high, decorative ceilings, refrigerated cooling, a generous mud room/laundry, storage galore and much more. A second, 2 bedroom residence would be ideal as a care takers residence, a comfortable home for a 2nd family or guest retreat, boasting kitchen, bathroom, heating and cooling.
Outdoors has been tailored for thoroughbred's but would accommodate all stock. Improvements include bitumen drive, 4 car garage, over 20 horse paddocks with post and rail fencing, 8 lined shelters, stable complex, large, lock up machinery shed, round yard, electronic gate with security pad, full irrigation and beautifully manicured gardens. Over 300 metres of beach frontage, showcasing panoramic views of French Island, Author's Seat and beyond makes for truly exceptional real estate.
The property offers the fortunate buyer a potentially lucrative business opportunity through multiple revenue streams. One prospect is horse agistment, with the current owner offering to lease back paddocks for an indefinite period, generating approximately $52,000 P.A. The property also lends itself to being run as a B&B, wedding reception/function centre or farm stays. The possibilities are endless.
