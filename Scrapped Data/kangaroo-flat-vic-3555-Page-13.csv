kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,6/21 John Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Stylish 1 bedroom + Study Townhouse
Impeccably presented, stunning timber floors bring welcome contrast and visual warmth to the decor. Highly efficient, the 1 bedroom plus study floorplan has no hallways to waste expenditure on unutilised energy, by not heating and cooling unused spaces.
This is evident in the European-style laundry and galley kitchen, where quality fittings and finishes include stone benchtops and a sleek ceramic glass cooktop. As well as a light-filled living-dining room, there is a substantial computer room for use as a home office. Lit by an interior window during the day, a spacious shower-room also contains the toilet and vanity. Reverse cycle air-conditioning sustains continuous relief from external temperatures.
A complete wall of built-in robes supplies sufficient storage in the bedroom.
Entirely landscaped grounds in attractive yet easy to care for fashion makes life even more restful at this address, as does the private rear courtyard.
An extra-wide single carport has your vehicle covered too.
This surprisingly handy location is within 8 to 20 minutes stroll of shopping, sports club, leisure centre, pub, medical facilities, train station and much more. Bus stops are around the corner, Bendigo is just 5 kilometres away, Melbourne under 150 into the CBD.
It's a townhouse that truly encapsulates a lifestyle of relaxation and convenience.
