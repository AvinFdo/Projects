Positioned a stones throw from Dandenong CBD and all amenities including Dandenong Railway Station, Dandenong Plaza and Market, cafes, restaurants and schools, this corner allotment with unprecedented development potential is your opportunity to invest into a suburb which saw 5.2% capital improvement in the last quarter of 2019. The 454 sqm lot in a Mixed Use Zone (Greater Dandenong Planning Scheme) allows for a variety of development options including commercial, residential and medical (STCA) and has existing plans and expired planning permit (application for extension issued to council) for a three level building with ground floor car parking, first floor commercial space and second floor apartments which are both 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom. Alternatively the 17.10 meter by 26.9 meter length lot allows for the development of multiple street facing units/townhouses in a high demand area with excellent resale/rental values.
The existing 3 bedroom, 1 bathroom home also gives savvy home owners/investors an opportunity to renovate and move in or lease out whilst significantly improving capital value in a central location.
