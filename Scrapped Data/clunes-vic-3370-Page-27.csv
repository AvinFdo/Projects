clunes-vic-3370,"""Ambleside Blampied-Mollongghip Road Mount Prospect VIC 3364","Unique Potato property - 309 acres (125ha) with water
The brand, land, equipment and water - Walk in/Walk Out
$4,200,000 (+ gst if applicable)
Situated in this highly prized location just north of Ballarat and approx. 90 minutes from Melbourne, is this opportunity to secure a wonderful turn-key operation, iconic potato brand and significant land/water holding in the renowned horticultural precinct of Mount Prospect.
Divided into 10 main paddocks and on two titles, about 90% of the total property area has been cultivated; rotating with potatoes, cereals, pasture in conjunction with a prime lamb operation.
The heart of the farm is based on the family established ""Mount Prospect Produce®"" brand; eight varieties of branded washed and brushed potatoes to predominantly wholesalers, restaurants and retailers, also straight from the farm gate giving the ultimate provenance experience. Of recent times, an export opportunity has also been established direct to Singapore.
The property is run using biological farming methods to ensure produce is grown in balance with nature and is as nutritious as possible.
There is a 120ML ground water entitlement included, which fills the main irrigation dam which has a further 25ML of surface entitlement. The main 80m depth irrigation bore rated at 14,000 gal/hr is equipped with a submersible 30hp pump, servicing the irrigation needs of the property via a series of underground piping and hydrants. There are a further 2 stock and domestic bores on the property.
The near new purpose built 2,200m2 main packing/machinery shed with 80% concrete flooring provides the ideal hub of packing, processing and storage and is completed with staff amenities, two office/staff areas and further machinery shed and new toilet/shower block. A serviceable two-stand Woolshed, sheep and cattle-yards, and hayshed further compliment this outstanding operation.
Financial statements and inventory list available upon request from agent on provision of a signed confidentiality agreement. GST may be applicable.
