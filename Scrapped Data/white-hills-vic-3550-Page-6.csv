white-hills-vic-3550,440 Napier Street White Hills VIC 3550,"Edwardian charm with modern updates.
Modern styles come and go but genuine period homes are forever as ""Ellesmere"", a first class Edwardian home proves.
Built circa 1900 and charmed with period features, a recent renovation and redecoration has taken it from old and dated to a stylish and elegant 21st century home.
External features include return verandah with turned verandah posts, simple timber balustrade and decorative frieze, detailed barge boards with finial and a sun canopy over the front window.
Inside, it boasts spinal hallway with feature arch, 3.6m pine-lined ceilings throughout living areas, polished timber floors and lead-light glazed windows to mention a few.
Accommodation consists of three larger-than average bedrooms, all with open fireplaces adorned with timber over mantles and built-in robes.
Two have decorative ceilings and cornice while the main includes a sweet window seat overlooking the front verandah.
The lounge is a snug and stylish space opening to spacious living/dining areas with access from both the return verandah and through French doors to the rear verandah/alfresco deck.
Modern kitchens and bathrooms are essential ingredients for today's lifestyle and these do not disappoint.
The country-style kitchen is equipped with a gas cooktop, electric oven, dishwasher, pantry cupboard and island breakfast bar while the totally revamped bathroom has timber vanity, shower, WC and freestanding, claw-foot slipper-style bathtub made for long relaxing soaks.
Large, storage-rich laundry, second WC with shower, central heating and reverse cycle air conditioning complete the internal picture.
Outside, the manicured front garden features a traditional picket fence with standard roses bordering brick pathways while the rear brick-paved courtyard has a studio/home office tucked in the corner and carport accessed via a private driveway off Grace Street.
Located close to Lake Weeroona, the CBD and public transport, this ageless property makes a fine family home but has recently served as boutique short-term accommodation offering buyers plenty of flexibility.
With an abundance of antique furniture, this property has potential plus for those looking to get into the furnished-accommodation/BNB market.
