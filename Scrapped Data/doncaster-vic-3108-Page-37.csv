The chance to buy one potential-rich property in the booming heart of Doncaster is rare at the best of times, so when the opportunity presents itself to buy two side-by-side homes along this premier neighbourhood, you'd want to act quickly to secure this rare piece of Manningham real estate.
Total land size 656.70sqm (approx.), astute buyers have an outstanding opportunity to capitalise on the property's DDO8 zoning and develop within walking distance of Ruffey Lake Park, Westfield Shoppingtown, bus services, Doncaster Primary School and Doncaster Secondary College (STCA).

Towering above the leafy surrounds of Doncaster Hill, 'Magnolia' raises the bar for modern, executive living, with fifteen levels of stylish, boutique apartments and two communal living spaces that will take your breath away. Framed by landscaped gardens and tranquil water features, secure entry will see you into a grand foyer with freestanding fireplace and built-in seating for awaiting guests. Lift access will guide you up to the third floor apartment, where oak timber floors welcome you into your own private sanctuary, thoughtfully designed by renowned CHT Architects. A statement in style and class, the timber veneer kitchen will immediately catch your eye; complete with built-in LED lights, stone bench tops, soft-close cabinetry and Asko stainless steel appliances including a dishwasher. The open living zone is the perfect place to recline or enjoy your culinary delights, with the adjoining covered alfresco providing idyllic outdoor entertaining. Two carpeted bedrooms with mirrored robes take care of accommodation and are complemented by a chic floor-to-ceiling tiled bathroom with recessed shelving, a floating vanity and frameless glass shower. A cleverly concealed European laundry and wall of built-in cupboards complete the apartment floorplan - that is further enhanced by the inclusion of split system heating/cooling, camera intercom, double glazed windows and a basement car park with storage cage. Communal living is rarely offered in this type of setting, but in this instance you will have two spectacular terraces to indulge in. Entertain family and friends or get to know your neighbours in a social setting; while taking in landscaped surrounds and uninterrupted views towards the city in one direction and Melbourne's East in the other. Both terraces have built-in barbeques; level 14 being the roof-top, level 12 providing a luxe kitchen and living suite complete with his/hers bathroom facilities. Positioned for unrivalled inner-suburban convenience, 'Magnolia' is only a few hundred metres from Westfield Shopping Centre, Doncaster Primary School, the library, parks and buses, with the nearby Eastern freeway providing an easy 15km commute into the CBD.","SOLD - $472,000","2

Those on the lookout for a neat and tidy unit combining a low maintenance lifestyle with an idyllic location on the Balwyn fringe need not look any further: this is a single-level unit that's poised to arouse curiosity among entry-level buyers, downsizers and investors alike.
There's no shortage of spoils for the lucky buyer. Walk across High St and hop on a bus at the Park + Ride for a stress-free commute into the CBD, and having Eastlink close by means weekend day trips to the Mornington Peninsula will become a regular pastime. Add to the mix swift access to trendy Greythorn shops and cafes, schools and Westfield Shoppingtown and this location is five-star in every sense.
The low maintenance nature of this neatly packaged unit will greatly appeal to empty nesters looking to downsize into a unit that's easy to maintain, while it goes without saying that the property's immense rental potential will prick the ears of the seasoned investor.
The manner in which the light-filled living and open-plan kitchen/meals area integrate creates a flowing living space, while a north-facing courtyard is the epitome of low maintenance living.

doncaster-vic-3108,28 Outlook Drive Doncaster VIC 3108,"A private 1,135sqm family oasis in the heart of Doncaster.
Dismiss what you think you know about a family home in Doncaster for here is an architecturally designed family home that's unlike anything you've ever seen in the heart of Doncaster.
Beautifully sited amidst breathtaking gardens that create a wall of privacy and tranquillity usually reserved for homes in Warrandyte, this hidden oasis offers a natural escape within a short walk of Westfield Shoppingtown, Doncaster primary and secondary schools, Doncaster Library, bus services and Marshall Ave Reserve, which is over the back fence. Who said you can't have country-style serenity with city conveniences!
Brilliantly designed with a scenic outlook from every window, this triumph of architectural design captivates with its curved ceilings, glass brick walls, Shugg windows, connection with its natural surrounds and numerous architectural inspired features in addition to delivering an innovative split-level floorplan that celebrates the notion of family.
Accommodation quarters are thoughtfully zoned in privacy, with three bedrooms of generous proportions and a bright family bathroom sweeping off the home's entry, while the entire first floor has been reserved for the parents' enjoyment. Featuring a robed bedroom, ensuite and light-filled study/retreat, it's the ultimate parents' retreat.
French doors provide a seamless link between the peaceful lounge/dining (with fireplace) and entertainer's deck, where you can sip on your morning coffee or indulge in a cocktail at sunset amidst a chorus of birdsong. And given the deck's direct outlook across the picture-perfect backyard that features a large lawn area, basketball half court, cubby house and outdoor dining area set beneath towering leafy trees, keeping an eye on the kids is incredibly relaxing.
The positive impressions extend to the radiant open-plan living area, where scenic views are a given and an excellent timber kitchen with a Lofra 600mm freestanding stainless steel cooker, ASKO dishwasher and walk-in pantry makes preparing family feasts a breeze.
Climate controlled with split-system cooling and ducted heating, this standout family home also features a security alarm, polished timber floors, separate laundry, loads of storage, a tandem double garage and convenient access to the Eastern Freeway.","SOLD - $1,420,000","4
