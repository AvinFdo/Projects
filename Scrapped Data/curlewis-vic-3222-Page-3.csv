curlewis-vic-3222,28-30 Anstead Avenue Curlewis VIC 3222,"Family home with room for the van or boat!
HIGH on the wishlist of buyers we talk to is somewhere to store their toys - so you're going to love having side access and an additional garage for your van, boat, trailer - whatever it is you want to keep safe. Whether you're looking to upgrade the family home, or downsizing but still want plenty of room for the grandkids, your search ends now!
You'll love living here because you're close to everything. You can walk to the shops, drop the kids off to school in minutes, or if you're lucky enough to have some 'me time' - launch the boat off Clifton Springs or play the back 9 at Curlewis Golf Club.
The light-filled open-plan kitchen/dining/living extends perfectly onto the alfresco, and your kitchen is complete with all the luxuries you wish for including stone benchtops, walk-in pantry and quality stainless steel appliances. A separate lounge helps when there's a clash of TV shows, or keep it open so you can keep an eye on things. Whether your just hanging at home with the kids or entertaining, you'll enjoy having line of sight from the kitchen to the flat grassed backyard and alfresco.
The Master Bedroom with ensuite and walk-in robe is positioned cleverly away from the 3 kids' bedrooms that also have walk-in robes. They share a central bathroom, but the inclusion of a powder room with the separate toilet was a master stroke and ensures guests don't need to enter the kids' bathroom - winning!
This one is sure to be popular - call now to avoid disappointment.","SOLD - $700,000","4
