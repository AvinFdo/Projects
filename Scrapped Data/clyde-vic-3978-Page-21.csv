clyde-vic-3978,Clyde VIC 3978,"190 Acres of Prime Development Opportunity on 2 titles
Alex Scott are proud to present this large parcel of land on two titles and all the options it presents.
Horses, cattle, crops, land bank or all of the above - you decide.
Currently used as a successful Wagyu cattle and Warmblood and thoroughbred stud, one option would be to continue to enjoy this property in its current use.
Horse facilities include multiple paddocks and yards ( including 3 foaling paddocks, 3 stallion paddocks, several day yards and 6 large approx 15 acres paddocks to allow your horses to roam and stretch their legs and be horses, as well as another 10 horse paddocks of varying sizes)
Almost all the horse paddocks have large run in sheds with the larger paddocks having 6x3metre sheds.
Other horse facilities include 8 large stables , extra wide breezeway, a large post and rubber lined round yard, a 70 x 35 metre fully fenced sand ménage and under cover float parking area.
All horse paddocks are either post and rail or 3 strand electric plus one strand sight wire.
The cattle facilities include a large bull paddock separated by a laneway and extra high fences from the 3 large cattle paddocks (2 x 20 acre approx and 1 x 40 acre approx) All cattle paddocks are less than two years old including the boundary fence and are all barb wire.
There are also centrally located new cattle yards and a crush connected by multiple laneways for easy one person operation.
Water to stock is by way of a bore.
There is ample shedding including a huge hay shed able to store over 200 large round bales, a large ex-shearing shed/ workshop, a lockable tack room and a feed room.
The black peat soil on the property also lends itself to growing crops, including asparagus, for which the region is world famous for.
All this within 5 km of the Urban Growth Zone. 3 minutes from Tooradin , 10 minutes from Cranbourne , 15 minutes from Pakenham , or jump on the Monash freeway and be in the CBD in the about 50 mins.
Based on projections by the Bureau of Statistics - by 2060 Melbourne will overtake Sydney doubling its population to 8.5 million, making land on the city fringe the place to buy. Besides from Melbourne doubling its population over the next thirty years there are a number of projects that may go ahead which would be a huge boost to the local area like dredging in Tooradin for international shipping and an international airport in Lang Lang. Both of these major projects could create over 150,000 local jobs resulting in greater need for housing, commercial and industrial land.
There is a 3 bedroom home that is habitable but in need of TLC or TNT. The current owners have a current planning and building permit to build a new home but due to a change in circumstances have decided not to build and are motivated to sell.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"3
