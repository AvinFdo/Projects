Rewrite history in Ormond's historic hill precinct. High on the hill, well in the Zone and a walk to the shopping strip and station, the sale of this approx 507sqm site (with wide 21.58m frontage) is truly a step back in time! The last of the old market garden allotments, this perfect-sized site sits on the old orchard garden of one of the area's original Victorian mansions ...now it's ready to watch a family grow or to help grow wealth in a new era.
Offered with architectural plans for a substantial four bedroom, two bathroom, dual zone single-level family home with garaging and parking to the front and perfect-sized gardens all around, this exciting site also offers the opportunity to re-design and custom-build to your own needs ...with potential to capture broad views from a two-storey home ...or to capture the demand for prestige housing in the McKinnon College Zone with a clever dual occupancy development (subject to Council Approval).
See through the vision already planned for this prime site or step up and take a new view of arguably the area's best address. However you see the future for this grand old garden, there's enormous growth potential here!",SOLD - Price Withheld,"4
