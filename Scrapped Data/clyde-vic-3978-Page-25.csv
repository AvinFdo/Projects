There are also another 2 double bedrooms with robes and a gorgeous fully tiled bathroom plus another separate WC to service upstairs.
Letâs not forget the ducted heating throughout, the massive shedding that includes a high clearance open garage (9m x 6.5m x 3.2m), the double remote garage (9m x 6m) converted to a man cave for the boys, with wood heating and a bar and finally all the extra driveway parking.
All of this is in close proximity to Woolworths, cafes, take away foods, Bunnings, train stations, buses, parks, sporting grounds, Schools and Kindergartens and only a 5 minute drive to the Cranbourne Park Shopping Centre and finally, within easy access to both the City and Bays.
