coronet-bay-vic-3984,17 Barker St Corinella VIC 3984,"Gardening or Fishing?? Why Not Have Both!!
Nestled at the back of this large 1062m2 allotment on a quiet road this cute 2 bedroom log cabin is waiting for its new owners to move in. Surrounded on three sides by a wide veranda with views to the gardens this property offers privacy, yet the generous size of the block gives a feeling of room to move.
Keeping in style with log cabin design the home has high ceilings and exposed beams, cosy wood panelling and country style light fittings. The house is kept warm from a combustion wood heater that doubles as a stove top/oven, handy for cooking that mouth-watering stew over winter. The cosy kitchen includes gas cooking, pantry, and overlooks the raised brick garden beds you could grow your herbs and veggies in. Both bedrooms have built in robes, the master with extra storage space, and the bathroom is in a handy central location.
Outside in the garden you will find no less than 12 varieties of established fruit/nut trees, an extra water tank to supply the kitchen, chook yard and a fully fenced yard. Add these to the roses and other flowering plants being self -sufficient could very easily become a reality, imagine the dollars saved! The man of the house is no less spoiled with an extra-large shed to the front of the property that has roller doors at both ends allowing for easy access or drive through. Power is connected, there is a mezzanine floor with loads of storage space and insulation has been added, making it the perfect potential man cave or boat/car area. At the front of the drive is a solid gantry for lifting those boat motors (we all know how heavy they can be right!!!) or any other block and tackle requiring maintenance. There is water connected at the shed to hose down the boat after catching your dinner in the bay only three minutes away.
Corinella is a developing area offering newly revamped 24 hour boat ramp, café and restaurant, general store/post office/ bait and tackle store, community centre, tennis courts, lawn bowls, local primary school and day care centre. Ten minutes away is Grantville, where you will find chemist, post office, cafes, doctor, ambulance depot and more. The dual lane bass highway is a mere 5 minutes drive for easy commute to the cbd, or enjoy the scenic 25 minute drive to famous Phillip island and get great views overlooking western port bay.

coronet-bay-vic-3984,11 Clarks Road Lang Lang VIC 3984,"Display Home Quality and Finish
Located in the sought after Summerfields Estate is this almost new family home. Surrounded by brand new homes and overlooking the Lang Lang Showgrounds Reserve. The home is only a short walk to everything that downtown Lang Lang has to offer. The Lang Lang Primary school is only a short trip around the corner too.
The home itself has been built with quality and functionality throughout. The sun drenched North facing living area is a real highlight. Situated on a large block of 656m2 you will enjoy not only a large family home, but also a large rear and side yard as well.
Opening up to the spacious hallway you will feel the high 9ft ceilings straight away, giving the home a more liveable feel than most other homes. The master bedroom is completed with the double vanity with matching his and hers sinks and mirrors. Completed with Ceasarstone benchtops the bathroom is both airy and spacious.
Moving down the hallway you will get to the point where the home opens up and you will decide that this is the one. Open plan in its design the entertainers kitchen with Caesarstone benches will bring out the Masterchef in you. Cook in the 900m oven with same size gas cooktop. Another added feature being the glass window splashback, which not only adds light in during the day, looks just amazing at night too. And these days a kitchen is not complete without your own butlers pantry.
The meals and living area are one of the real highlights of the home. Facing north, the area is bathed in light. Bringing the outside inside you also have access through the triple stacker rear doors to your alfresco areas for those warm summer nights.
And if you have children who want double beds the remaining three bedrooms are all oversized and would have plenty of room left over.
Complete with gas ducted heating and evaporative cooling.
The double garage has remote and internal access, there is also potential for rear access down the side of the home as well if you have a boat or caravan.
I'm not sure where to stop, there is plenty more highlights, so I will finish with an old real estate cliché, an inspection will not disappoint, so make sure to book in an inspection or attend any advertised open home.
