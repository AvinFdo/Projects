clunes-vic-3370,30 Service Street Clunes VIC 3370,"Immaculate centrally located light filled home
Centrally located in a tightly-held area, this opportunity is not to be missed. Built in the 1940s by a well-regarded local builder, this double fronted home has been lovingly refurbished over the past decade by the current owner keeping true to the era of mid-century Art Deco with some very special and exceptional inclusions. Original polished Baltic pine floorboards, picture rails and glass panelled doors provide continuity of architectural aesthetic throughout.
Upon entering, the foyer is wide and welcoming. Two of the 4 bedrooms are located in the front portion of the home. These rooms are both of generous proportions, second bedroom is the ideal home office or library; both front bedrooms have additional TV points.
Bathroom fittings include a unique Shanks nickel-plated brass shower screen sourced from a stately Toorak home and installed over the bath. The vanity and accompanying overhead cupboard are both original to the period and provide ample bathroom storage.
The easterly facing lounge has lovely sash corner windows for morning sun, and on winters days is warmed by a gas flame log heater set over drip-glaze mid-century hearth tiles sourced from a Bulleen mansion.
Flowing on through, the kitchen/dining area leads to the additional two bedrooms. Bedroom 3 has original timber panelling and incorporates a second gas log heater; this versatile space would make a charming formal breakfast room. Bedroom 4 overlooks the undercover area and would make an ideal office or sewing room with plenty of afternoon sunlight. The original stove cavity has been repurposed in the dining area to host a solid fuel heater surrounded by curved Art Deco style cabinetry inspired by English Country kitchens, with Blackwood mantelpiece and custom-designed brushed steel hearth.
Spacious dining area with feature wall lighting, amply accommodates seating for up to 12 persons. Kitchen refurbishment includes a Smeg Victoria stove with gas cooktop and electric ovens, custom Blackwood benchtops, Miele dishwasher with a fabulous behind sink window allowing plentiful natural light. Flooring throughout the kitchen, abundantly light filled breakfast area in the north-west corner and second bathroom/laundry is imported European Marmoleum, a natural product with coved edges providing an easy to clean and fabulous flooring surface.

Raised garden beds line the boundary, and a handy outdoor trough is conveniently placed for clean up after enjoying time in the garden. Ample off street parking alongside the home, plus good sized garage/workshop with storage alcove.

clunes-vic-3370,102 Bailey Street Clunes VIC 3370,"Become a custodian of Victorian Goldfields history with this once in a lifetime opportunity being the Clunes Post Office building (circa 1879)
Set across 1147sqm is this impressive property which would be one of the most prominent buildings of its era in the township of Clunes.
The Clunes Post and Telegraph Office was built in 1879 to a design by the Public Works Department. The principal building was constructed by Messrs Lewis and Roberts at a cost of £4099 and the kitchen outbuildings were constructed by Charles Morgan & Co for an additional £279. The building replaced an earlier and smaller post office built in 1861. That the current building is so much bigger and grander than its predecessor is indicative of the township's rapid expansion and peaking of population in the 1870s as a result of both the deep-lead mining and the coming of the railway in 1874.
The building is designed in an Italian Renaissance ""palazzo"" style, is of two storeys, and is constructed of rendered brick with a slate roof. The ground floor post and telegraph office is entered via a recessed arcaded loggia with the entrance to the post-master's residence on the first floor via a lobby to the side of the building.
The building is of significance as a well-executed and preserved example of public Renaissance Revival design, as an indication of the prosperity of the developed Clunes goldfields (the area of first gold strike in Victoria) and as a key element within the historic townscape of Clunes.'
The most recent use of the building has been for a residence and library which has been opened regularly to the public and is a popular attraction during the famed annual Booktown Festival in Clunes.
The building offers a variety of possibilities and uses with approx. 5 bedrooms, multiple living areas, country style kitchen, large library area, study space, huge hallways, an original timber staircase, impressive cornices and finishings and feature fireplaces.
The property lends itself to further improvement and could be ideal for a business, residence, bed and breakfast or to renovate/restore then on sell.
Situated just a short stroll from shops, cafes, churches, school, only 30 mins to Ballarat and 1 hour 40 mins to Melbourne.
Opportunities such as this are rare and this property is sure to attract national attention so be sure to book your inspection ASAP.
