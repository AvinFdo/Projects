On an allotment 1213m2 with a current planning permit in place to subdivide, this Creswick property and its central location is sure to impress. Firstly potential developers can easily take advantage of the hard work being done by subdividing the land at the rear, with frontage onto Ayre St. The charming period features of the home will appeal to all, and being just a minutes' walk to the thriving heart of Creswick it makes enjoying what this town has to offer ever so easy. Previously tenanted at $240 this home is habitable as is, but for the hard working types there is scope for something special, with a fantastic north facing yard and renovation friendly layout. Although there is some hard work to be done, the positives this property has to offer will shine through. 1.5 hours from Melbourne, 15mins to Ballarat, but most importantly just metres from the wonderful, history filled town of Creswick.","SOLD - $278,000","3
