kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,3 Goodenia Avenue Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Bushland sanctuary minutes from conveniences
Nestled within a bushland sanctuary is a family habitat ideal for a first home, or buyers retiring from acreage and unwilling to drastically diminish their outdoor oasis. Inviting birds to feast upon the nectar of native flora, long ago planted and now thriving established gardens require minimal upkeep at this address. Nearby Forest Lake welcomes walkers to wander its banks enjoying wildlife experiences when swans raise their fluffy cygnets, ducklings dash past paddling with stealth, or roos bound by at dawn and dusk.
Bluestone-toned awnings shade front bay windows of the red brick exterior that also provides the convenience of a double carport. Indoors, 2 living zones are separated by a kitchen equipped with gas cooktop, electric oven and a dishwasher. Direct access is available to the family bathroom from the main bedroom and ducted heating keeps the entire home cosy in cool weather.
Paved and undercover, an immense outdoor entertaining area allows full appreciation of the picturesque vista across a backyard peppered with lofty eucalypts. Generously proportioned, the yard contains ample room for an extension (STCA). Fully fenced to enclose the boundary for the safety of pets and children, there's plenty of space to play around a couple of garden sheds beneath the shade of gum trees, if not a coolabah tree too!
It's only a 10 minute bike ride from schools, shopping, train station and other services, plus much faster by car of course. Set deep within a family-oriented, residential neighbourhood, there are so many reasons why this could be the one!","SOLD - $298,000","3
