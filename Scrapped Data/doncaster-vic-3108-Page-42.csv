Set within a unique private complex and surrounded by delightful gardens you'll find this little beauty! Lovingly maintained and beautifully presented this home is perfect for those seeking to downsize or even a young family looking for a great start!
The home offers 2 bedroom both with BIRs, a central bathroom and a spacious carpeted living room. Walking through you'll find an updated country style kitchen including all of the modern conveniences you'd expect with dining area and updated laundry. But wait, there's more!
The wow factor in this home has to be the family room or 'sunroom' if you wish, opening out to a stunning cottage courtyard complete with water feature. You'll also enjoy the hot tub in a second smaller courtyard on the opposite side.
This family room provides a family some flexibility if a third bedroom was needed, the front living room could be used as a large bedroom. A single lock up garage with room for a second vehicle in front finishes the picture nicely.
Location wise it is a beauty, with easy access to Ruffey Lake Park just 550 metres away, Aquarena just a short walk, public transport at the doorstep and Templestowe Village, Macedon Square and Mega shopping complex Westfield are all just minutes away too!

Sale By Set Date Tuesday 5th December at 6pm
Give your lifestyle the boost it deserves with the life-changing purchase of this ultra-contemporary three-bedroom apartment. And given it's fully furnished with couches, beds, an integrated refrigerator in the gourmet kitchen and whitegoods in the Euro laundry, you can do your hip pocket a massive favour by saving significant amounts on removalist fees!
Set within the fashionable 'Arbor' boutique apartment complex in the vibrant heart of Doncaster, it's also a sensational opportunity to experience one of Melbourne's sought-after lifestyles. The shopping, dining and entertainment Mecca that is Westfield Shoppingtown is only a short stroll away, while swift access to the Eastern Freeway/Eastlink means you can be in the CBD in 20 minutes (approx.) and sampling the gourmet eateries and popular wineries along the Mornington Peninsula in well under an hour. And with the Park + Ride and bus services also within walking distance and schools and parks just minutes away, we told you that living here is a lifestyle booster!
Once you're done exploring the best the area has to offer, return to an apartment that's been thoughtfully customised to achieve a higher level of living luxury.
Stone benchtops, high-end finishes, walk-in pantry and Miele appliances add substance and style to the bespoke kitchen, and you'll be sure to love the manner in which the radiant open-plan living area extends onto the large wraparound balcony, which excites its impressive size and scale, self-draining design, non-standard tinted glass and stunning views towards Box Hill and Melbourne's CBD.
Saying goodnight to the sparkling city lights in the distance will become a regular bedtime ritual given those same city views are broadcast straight into the Master bedroom, which also features built-in robes and an ensuite. Abundant space and comfort, meanwhile, also defines the two additional bedrooms, which are serviced by a sleek central bathroom with a semi-frameless shower and bath.
Offering a superior lock-and-leave experience for the professional couple and empty nesters, this cutting-edge apartment also features NBN fibre to the premises, NBN data ports to every room, secure lift access, video intercom entry, contemporary timber floors, square-set high ceilings, double-glazed windows, two secure side-by-side basement car spaces (next to lift well), storage cage and ducted refrigerated cooling and heating.","SOLD - $905,000","3
