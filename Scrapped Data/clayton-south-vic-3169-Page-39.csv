clayton-south-vic-3169,3 Beswick Street Clayton South VIC 3169,"DECEASED ESTATE
There really isn't much to tell about the home itself because quite obviously it has seen far better days. But there are many advantages to its location and it offers obvious potential for the future - all it needs is someone with the right vision to make it happen. On approximately 600sqm of flat land is a great position with no through traffic, the home features a lounge, kitchen/meals area, 2 bedrooms, a family bathroom plus another living or bedroom area with adjoining kitchenette. But it really would be best if you just bowled it over and started from scratch! And with a blank canvass you are free to dream, design and build a family home (STCA) that caters to your every need and want that your family has. A great location just seals the deal with Westall Secondary College literally over the back fence, Westall Primary School is next door and you can walk to buses, local shops and Westall train station.

clayton-south-vic-3169,14 Durham Place Clayton South VIC 3169,"STUNNING BUILD QUALITY & A GREAT FAMILY PACKAGE
The old saying 'they don't make them like they used to' is often overused but could not be more relevant to this property. The excellent build quality has stood the test of time impressively well. From its double brick ground floor to its suspended concrete slab top floor and beautiful detailing in between, it is testament to the owners who built it and now you have an opportunity to secure it for your family. Behind its classic facade you find an entry highlighted by its Italian marble tread staircase and gorgeous parquetry floors that feature throughout much of the home. The generous lounge is accompanied by a formal dining room and the immaculate kitchen with electric oven and stove plus a dishwasher. There are 4 large bedrooms with built in wardrobes upstairs including the main that opens to the large front balcony as well as a family bathroom and toilet on each level. The addition of hydronic heating is a rare treat and outside you find a tandem garage with an internal access door and a roll through door to the large north facing backyard. A great location completes the picture with buses and Westall primary and secondary schools right around the corner while Westall train station is just a few minutes away.","SOLD - $590,444","4
