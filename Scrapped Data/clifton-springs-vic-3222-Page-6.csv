clifton-springs-vic-3222,33 Whitcombes Road Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"The Great Escape
There is a certain charm only found in weather board houses, a warmth of a loved family home with a gaslog fireplace to high vaulted timber ceilings. This house is a home with a special ambience.
Getaway from it all & enjoy your own idyllic world. A commanding entertainment balcony overlooks your private backyard.
A secluded side entry is a doorknockers nightmare, while the split level design separates the three upper level bedrooms from the main living level.
Stepping down to the main living room as it opens up to the modern kitchen with stainless steel appliances including a 900 mm oven & double fridge cavity. White sleek lines, composite stone bench tops & a window looking out to the balcony makes this kitchen a joy to entertain.
Step out onto the modern full length balcony & get down to some serious entertaining or take the time to relax.
The lower level is ideally suited for co-habitation if you require; with a living / rumpus room with external access to a paved undercover entertaining area; a large master bedroom with ensuite.
A secluded backyard with ample lawn & well designed garden beds, there is even room for a chookpen.
All the focus of this home is on whats hidden, not the street.
A large 4 x 8 metre shed with easy street access complements the ample hardstanding for parking out front, you'll never be short of car, boat & guest parking.","SOLD - $583,500","4

Looking directly out onto the neat landscaped front garden, the master suite features a very generous walk in robe and perfectly proportioned ensuite complete with shower, vanity and toilet.
The formal lounge room in the middle of the home separates the main bedroom from the rest of the house, offering a space that could be used for the younger members of the family to enjoy their favourite shows or a retreat for mum and dad. The formal dining room is currently used as a study.
The open plan kitchen, with an Electrolux dishwasher, Simpson stovetop and rangehood for the chef, complementing the spacious dining and lounge areas. Brand new carpet and polished floorboards throughout finish these areas off marvellously, with ducted heating and split system air conditioning to keep the house warm in Winter and cool in Summer.
A central bathroom services two more bedrooms, both with built in robes and more than enough room for the rest of the family.
A covered outdoor area provides space for a barbecue or outdoor setting under shade from the elements, with more room for family and friends to enjoy in the backyard.
A garden shed, double garage and prime position within walking distance to parkland, schools and shops make this home an absolute winner.","SOLD - $514,000","3

clifton-springs-vic-3222,3 Maraboora Avenue Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"Private north facing backyard with bay views
Privacy, charm and tranquillity are words that come to mind when stepping inside this family home. Inspecting this home is a must, as soon as you step inside the front door you realise the potential this property has to offer. The central living area has exposed beams that separates the master suite from the rest of the home.
The large master bedroom impresses with wall to floor mirrored built in robes. A freestanding vanity complements a very generous en-suite that has it's own exterior access into the large north facing garden.
Kitchen features include a five burner gas stove, dishwasher, breakfast bar, bay views and an enormous walk in pantry. The size and open plan aspect of the dining and family area allow for an arrangement of furniture layouts. You can relax in front of the gaslog fire and enjoy the views of the garden through the wide north facing windows.
The second and third bedrooms are serviced by a central bathroom and laundry that includes toilet, vanity and shower.
A large covered outdoor area suitable for summer entertaining is only one small element of this enormous private backyard. Garden boxes and fruit trees pepper the yard, with plenty of space for the family and the dog to run around.
This house is conveniently located in an established area within easy walking distance to the bayside beaches and nearby parklands. Clifton Springs Primary School and the new local playground are only minutes away by foot. Curlewis shopping centre is just a short drive away and further afield are the fabulous attractions of the Bellarine.
