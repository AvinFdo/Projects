coronet-bay-vic-3984,19 Stewart Street Grantville VIC 3984,"BEACHSIDE WITH SOLAR ON STEWART!
This gem of a home is in a very quiet part of Grantville and enjoys a short cut from Stewart Street straight onto the sandy beach. It's a bit of hidden secret where locals walk to the beach leaving cars and parking problems behind. The house is a roomy 3 bedroom beach house with good old fashioned sized rooms which have been improved by the current owners. There is new carpeting, a full en-suite bathroom to the master, timber lined ceilings and a new dine-in kitchen. Some new aluminium windows and decking have also been replaced. Best of all, the house has a solar system with bills of only $45-$50 received per month in recent months. Outside there is parking under the carport which adjoins a very large garage which has both power and water connected. This home will suit either permanent living or use as a holiday home and being 100 metres to the beach path has to be a bonus.
