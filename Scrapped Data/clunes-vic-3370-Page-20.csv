While only being just 30 seconds back into the hub of town the abode has a feel of being private and quiet. There are three generous sized bedrooms and an office that could become an optional bedroom or nursery. The light filled living room offers spectacular views and entry out to the front balcony to enjoy maybe a glass of wine. There are external blinds for west facing windows during summer. The home is set on a large 1672m2 block that allows for gardens, work shop, garden shedding, double garage and still loads of lawn area for family fun. Charming as it is, there is still scope for people to add their new internal colour-scheme or maybe a little renovation. Glorious properties like this don't arise every day, so get in fast.
