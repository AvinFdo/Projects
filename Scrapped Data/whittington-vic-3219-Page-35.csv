whittington-vic-3219,26 Wilsons Road Newcomb VIC 3219,"CORNER THIS OPPORTUNITY
Buyers are spoilt for choice with this Newcomb property ripe for renovation or redevelopment on a 660sq m corner block less than 10 minutes drive from Geelongs CBD.
The choice is yours renovate and extend the existing weatherboard house into the massive, sun-soaked allotment of land; renovate the house and subdivide the backyard; or subdivide the whole site for redevelopment.
Location and convenience are key drawcards. The Geelong Botanic Gardens and popular Waterfront precinct are just minutes away, while two nearby shopping strips and the Newcomb Central Shopping Center cater for your local dining and supermarket needs.
Newcomb Library and a selection of schools, including Christ the King Catholic Primary, Newcomb Park Primary and Newcomb Secondary College, are all within the local neighbourhood too.
And if you commute to work, a bus running alongside the property on Charles St will take you to Geelong Railway Station or the CBD.
The home retains many original features from its heydays of the 1960s and 1970s but will need some TLC if its new owners opt to renovate.
But the basics are there a huge main bedroom overlooking the established front garden, two further bedrooms, central bathroom, separate toilet, an L-shaped dining, lounge and kitchen area, and large laundry with an extra shower.
And theres plenty of land to extend to create your dream home. Out the back, a two-room bungalow can provide extra accommodation, alongside a storage shed.
Further afield is a large grassed area full of fruit trees your own summer orchard.
Off-street parking and easy backyard access is available from Charles St.
If you decide to develop the site, the corner block is a massive plus, providing direct street access for any new accommodation.
And when youre done making decisions in this prime part of Newcomb, the nearby Bellarine Highway or Portarlington Rd will take you to the summer playground of the Bellarine Peninsula.","SOLD - $382,000","3
