doncaster-vic-3108,13 Soderlund Drive Doncaster VIC 3108,"A flat 808sqm block in Doncaster's most picturesque street.
Unearth the rich potential that exists on this flat 808sqm (approx.) allotment, which accommodates a blank canvas two-storey family home in Doncaster's most picturesque tree-lined street.
Only a short walk to Macedon Square shops, Manningham Medical Centre, bus services, St Gregory the Great Primary School and Westfield Shoppingtown, you don't need to be a local to understand why this street has five-star status in Manningham. Nor do you have to be a real estate aficionado to appreciate the once in a lifetime opportunity this potential-rich property represents.
With the twinkling lights of the Eureka Tower viewable from upstairs, there's potential to build a luxurious two-storey family home with a city view from the first floor (STCA) in a prized neighbourhood, yet with such incredible land dimensions, it's also tempting to extract full value from the perfectly proportioned block and create a first-class multi-unit site (STCA).
If renovating is more your thing, then channel your inner Shaynna Blaze and transform the original interior into a celebration of contemporary living that'll win The Block. Featuring an elegant formal lounge with a marble fireplace, formal dining, open-plan meals/kitchen area that opens onto the large backyard, downstairs master bedroom with semi-ensuite, large laundry, study and three additional bedrooms and an original bathroom upstairs, all the ingredients are there - the only thing left is your modern touch.
