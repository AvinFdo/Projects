drysdale-vic-3222,28 Newcombe Street DRYSDALE VIC 3222,"Circa 1870’s on 1 acre in the centre of town
This charming 1 acre approx. property provides a rare opportunity to own a private rural slice of inner Drysdale, with the option of subdivision (STCA) and the potential for a level of self-sufficiency. Just moments from the town centre this unique home is buffered by spacious grounds and hidden by an established shelter belt.
The original cottage dates from 1873. Subtle period features are carried through into more recent extensions, resulting in a modern and spacious 5 bedroom home with 2 living areas and an open plan kitchen.
Both lounge and living flow through French doors to inviting undercover outdoor areas. The spacious lounge adjoins the façade deck shaded by a specimen Elm. Living merges with a generously proportioned, northwest facing veranda that significantly increases the footprint for entertaining. The country-style kitchen is equipped with all mod cons (including Bosch dishwasher, Savoir-Faire 900mm oven, gas cooktop and range hood) and offers abundant storage.
With privacy in mind, the living zones divide the master and minor bedroom wings. The master bedroom boasts an en suite with shower room with basin and toilet. A family-sized laundry and bathroom, with spa bath and shower, adjoin the minor bedrooms. These rooms are double in size and sit within the original cottage.
Ducting for central gas heating. Split system AC to the central living hub.
Outdoor features are impressive. The detached ‘Hoochie’ is the ultimate man cave boasting concrete floor, wood burner, pizza oven and bar. The 6 bay machinery shed with high clearance sliding door, mezzanine storage, extensive workbench and huge open air parking bay is an important asset to a tradesman. Accesses from Newcombe Street and Portarlington Road aid business and subdivision potential. The rear half of the allotment offers open ground for animals and self-sufficiency (vegetable garden, fruit trees and chicken coop).
You’ll love the space, character and potential of this convenient Drysdale address. View without delay.","SOLD - $668,000","5

Dense and towering shelter-belt trees almost completely conceal this 18 ha – 44 acre approx property from the road, ensuring a secluded retreat for residents. Still in conveniently close proximity to the comprehensive shops and services of Drysdale, it offers a handy place to escape from the daily demands of modern life. Opportunity exists to renovate and/or extend the three bedroom brick dwelling or construction of a new residence could be a very exciting alternative (STCA), taking full advantage of panoramic scenery across Port Phillip bay. Huge dam and paddocks bordered by rural fencing, horse shelters in place plus round yard and 3-bay machinery/hay shed. Only 3km to primary schools and 6km to secondary schools makes for a quick school run. Massive river red gums and pines supply wonderful trees for children to climb. Central to a wealth of nearby beaches, both bay and ocean-side, tourist attractions abound on the Bellarine Peninsula. A terrific place for a weekend retreat or to reside permanently.
A beautiful setting less than 5 minutes to Drysdale, 20 minutes to Geelong, just over an hour to Melbourne (commuters can opt to catch a train from South Geelong station) and around 10 minutes to Ocean Grove beaches.","SOLD - $855,000","3
