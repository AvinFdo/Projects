coburg-vic-3058,4 Higinbotham Street Coburg VIC 3058,"A New Beginning Beckons
Ideally positioned within walking distance to Batman Train Station, Coburg North Primary School and Upfield Bike Path, this spacious three bedroom home is certainly placed for convenience and lifestyle enjoyment.
The floor plan incorporates rooms of generous proportions framed by high ceilings.
Three huge bedrooms introduce the home with living zones following at the rear, namely the kitchen/meals area and family room.
There's also a central bathroom, covered outdoor area, a separate laundry, old fashioned outhouse (second toilet) as well as evaporative air conditioning and electronic security shutters throughout plus off street parking at the front.
The home presents an excellent opportunity for renovators to restore and modernise with options to extend either outwards or upwards, both subject to council approval.
Alternatively, a great parcel of land in ever popular Coburg offers an exciting canvas upon which to design and build that elusive dream home (once again STCA).
Further enticement is generated by close proximity to iconic O'Heas Bakery, Coburg Shopping Centre, Sydney Road's cosmopolitan mix of shops and eateries, CityLink and beautiful Coburg Lake Reserve.","SOLD - $840,000","3
