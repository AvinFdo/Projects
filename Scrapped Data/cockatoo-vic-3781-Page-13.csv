""I grew up in suburbia and never liked the idea of having neighbours right next to me. I always wanted to live on land. I looked in Upper Beaconsfield and Officer but the land was too expensive and not that good.
I’d never been to Cockatoo but I started to look up here and I saw this site and loved it and just bought it straight away.""
