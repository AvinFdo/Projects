""House hunting is like a game of Where's Wally - you know what you're looking for but it's hard to find. Well, now you've finally found your Waldo. Welcome to 2 Topaz Way.""
The heart-warming, inviting home will inspire a generation. With stunning features and an unbridled integrity the property is the perfect fit for a queen and her family.
The home is the unique blend of joyous family living and strong, independent characteristics that were ahead of its time.
For example:
- At the heart of the home is the open plan living/dining room adjacent to the kitchen where the family can gather together;
- But at either end of the home are independent living quarters for a kids' rumpus room and a parents retreat;
- The decked area is central to the home and is conveniently west-facing to make the most of the setting sun;
- But on the south side is a courtyard which is perfect for a basketball area or a child's play area.
Located in the heart of Officer, it's walking distance to the train station, shops, Bridgewood Primary and Officer Secondary schools.
Other features include:
- A master bedroom with a walk-in robe and en-suite;
- Remaining bedrooms with walk-in robes;
- The house is fitted with heating and cooling;
- And includes a double car garage with remote access and dual entry points.
Be at peace, you're finally home.
