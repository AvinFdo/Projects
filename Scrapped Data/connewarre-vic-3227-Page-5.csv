connewarre-vic-3227,105 Bluestone School Road Connewarre VIC 3227,"The Best of Both Worlds
$775,000 - $850,000
Strategically positioned at the head of a prestigious court, in the heart of Connewarre village, is this supreme example of passive energy design and water efficiency, midway between Geelong and Barwon Heads within minutes of the beach. The return driveway leads to this stately homestead directly opposite the hidden gem that is the Connewarre recreation reserve and all amenities.
Whilst a substantial building, the foyer emits a feeling of warmth and welcome as you find your way into the expansive living, lounge and dining area with its beautifully appointed kitchen with granite bench tops, glass splashback and stainless steel appliances; it says family wherever you go. Be it along the broad, tiled hallways to the sisal carpeted bedroom of the parent's wing with its voguish en-suite and BIRs; or to the east wing where another four serviced bedrooms await your children and guests. It is an impressive home.
A well-appointed office overlooks the rear garden and just outside there is the oasis like solar heated pool and spa with its own amenities and gazebo with a turreted shelter adjacent, nothing has been too much for this most tasteful of homes. The garden is a joy to behold as you wander amidst its perennial layout and its own water treatment plant. The hothouse, surrounded by fruit and olive trees, awaits your next season's choice planting.
Further back toward the home is the huge workshed 12 x 6 m with 3 phase power. Water tanks are in abundance maintaining year round supply; and the inconspicuous solar hot water system for the homestead is typical of the many hidden benefits of this property.
