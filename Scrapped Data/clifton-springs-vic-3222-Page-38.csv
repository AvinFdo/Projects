clifton-springs-vic-3222,77 Bayshore Avenue Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"Big bay views and big potential!
The big bay views are breathtaking from Bayshore Avenue and this elevated 3-bedroom home is no exception! Boasting clear views of the You Yangs and turquoise waters of Port Phillip Bay, this home’s sweeping panorama includes the tranquil treed Golf Course to the east and and gorgeous lights of Geelong to the west. Comfortably livable as is, this solid build and large block scream ‘project’. Given the views and space, the results would be impressive (STCA)!
A northern balcony spans the facade bring you closer to the vista. Sunsets are stunning and comfortably enjoyed from the fully-enclosed western end of the balcony. The kitchen/meals/living room, separate lounge and master bedroom are spoilt with the scenic northern aspect.
The kitchen offers cooktop, wall oven and grill. An air conditioner and electric heater assist comfort. The lounge flows to the enclosed balcony increasing the footprint for entertaining. The master bedroom, with en suite access to the 2-way bathroom, flows from the lounge.
The minor bedrooms and laundry bud off a sunny landing with rear patio access. The landing, with split system, makes an ideal play space or study.
The living level is perched on top of a triple garage and workshop, ideal for tradies or those with ‘toys’. Ample off-street parking. At the rear, the patio is fenced and private. Beyond, the large yard is a blank canvas.
Use your imagination here, or simply enjoy the key asset - the view!","SOLD - $466,000","3
