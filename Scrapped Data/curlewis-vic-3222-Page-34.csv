curlewis-vic-3222,33 Whitcombes Road Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"The Great Escape
There is a certain charm only found in weather board houses, a warmth of a loved family home with a gaslog fireplace to high vaulted timber ceilings. This house is a home with a special ambience.
Getaway from it all & enjoy your own idyllic world. A commanding entertainment balcony overlooks your private backyard.
A secluded side entry is a doorknockers nightmare, while the split level design separates the three upper level bedrooms from the main living level.
Stepping down to the main living room as it opens up to the modern kitchen with stainless steel appliances including a 900 mm oven & double fridge cavity. White sleek lines, composite stone bench tops & a window looking out to the balcony makes this kitchen a joy to entertain.
Step out onto the modern full length balcony & get down to some serious entertaining or take the time to relax.
The lower level is ideally suited for co-habitation if you require; with a living / rumpus room with external access to a paved undercover entertaining area; a large master bedroom with ensuite.
A secluded backyard with ample lawn & well designed garden beds, there is even room for a chookpen.
All the focus of this home is on whats hidden, not the street.
A large 4 x 8 metre shed with easy street access complements the ample hardstanding for parking out front, you'll never be short of car, boat & guest parking.","SOLD - $583,500","4

Tucked away in a quiet cul-de-sac, and located on one of the high points of picturesque Clifton Springs, this impeccably-presented contemporary family home offers a delightful lifestyle - with some wonderful bay views as a bonus.

The open-plan kitchen/lounge/dining area is an entertainer's dream, with double sliding doors accessing a north-east facing deck - the perfect spot for drinks, barbecues, or just lazing about.

The galley-style kitchen offers a large Westinghouse electric oven with a 5-burner gas cooktop, an Asko dishwasher, and a large walk-in pantry connects to the compact laundry. A second entertainment/rumpus room sits adjacent to three more bedrooms, and the main bathroom offers a shower, bath and vanity, plus a separate WC. Ducted heating and cooling throughout the home ensure year-round comfort. Behind double gates at the front there's also room for a boat, trailer, or extra vehicle storage.
