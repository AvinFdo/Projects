Tucked away in a quiet blue-chip location and only a short stroll to Strath Village Shopping Centre, Kennington Reservoir and LaTrobe University is this spacious 2-bedroom unit on its own title, which means NO owners corp fees.
Features include lock-up garage, heating and cooling, spacious bedrooms with built in robes and a low-maintenance and private rear yard with room to grow a garden or for a small pet to play!
Near new bathroom has recently been fitted with some finishing touches required and a lick of paint through will realise its true potential.

Further along the hall is a third, robed bedroom and a stunning bathroom transformation featuring Natural Sandstone floor and wall tiling, walk-in-shower, full bath, vanity, toilet and a clever European-style laundry hidden behind double doors.
A stunning new extension opens to a spacious living area where a wall of glass beams light into every corner of the open-plan living and dining spaces and the kitchen with it's granite overlay benches, big five-burner Smeg stainless steel cook top and rangehood, Bosch dishwasher and island work station.

kennington-vic-3550,3 Sedgwick Close KENNINGTON VIC 3550,"Easy Living In Quiet Court
The great location of a quiet court, close to La Trobe University, schools, Strath Hill and Strath Village shopping centres and the ease of maintenance of this three-bedroom home on a 507-square-metre-block makes this Russell Parsons-built home an ideal proposition for a range of buyers from first home to downsizers to investors. A mix of Oregon beams and pine boards are used in the cathedral ceilings which straddle the north-west side of the house, their loftiness adding another dimension to the interior. The house has a gas heater and a reverse-cycle split-system. Big windows in the formal lounge and dining rooms overlook a paved, sunny terrace with a vine-clad pergola above, the perfect place for a barbecue or early morning cuppa. Rustic slate flooring is used throughout the house (except for the bedrooms and formal lounge room), the colours combining well with the pale timber cabinetry in the galley-style kitchen, and the neutral décor. There's a dishwasher, above-bench fan-forced electric oven and hotplates in the kitchen. Storage includes a built-in pantry and an appliance hutch. Three bedrooms are on the south side of the house. Two have built-in wardrobes and the main has a walk-in wardrobe. All share a four-piece bathroom which has two-way access. There is a second separate toilet with hand basin adjoins the laundry. The double garage has roller doors and can be accessed from the house.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"3
