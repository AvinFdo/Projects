clyde-vic-3978,5 Kelly Terrace Sandhurst VIC 3977,"INSPECTION BY PRIVATE APPOINTMENT ANYTIME.
The discerning buyer will immediately recognise the value and appeal of this great family home. Tucked into a quiet court location and literally a stones throw to the magnificent Members Clubhouse, 5 Kelly Terrace is the type of home to suit so many different families.
Built by Henley Homes and offering an interactive floor plan, this is the home for either young families or teenagers alike.
As you enter the home you will find a generous study to the front with double bi fold doors. This is the perfect space for those working from home or VCE students.
The large lounge at the centre of the property could also double as a billiard room if desired.
Opposite this room is a great spot which could be used as a home theatre or 5th bedroom for guests or elderly parents.
This is serviced by a full bathroom downstairs.
The gourmet kitchen with granite bench tops and stainless steel appliances presides over the family and dining area. Double sliding doors lead outside to the pretty rear garden with established trees and plants.
Upstairs are 4 large bedrooms. The master suite has a lovely ensuite with spa bath and double basins whilst the other 3 rooms all offer built in robes.
A comfortable sitting room upstairs provides another living zone for family members.
Low maintenance gardens and paths surround the home so you can take advantage of the lifestyle benefits Sandhurst offers so many of.","SOLD - $825,000","4
