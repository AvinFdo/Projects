Elevated ground floor in a boutique block of only 12 units will put this property on the top of everybody's shopping list.

The bathroom has been renovated to high standard and the kitchen allows you to cook an entire three course meal without ever having to move from the one spot. The position puts you seconds away from the famous Tivoli Road bakery and rear access to river lane means you can walk to do your grocery shopping in the vogue plaza which is only 300m away.
