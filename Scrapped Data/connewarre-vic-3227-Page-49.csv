The superb kitchen is complete with large butler's pantry, Siemens pyrolytic oven and combination induction/gas cooktop, Qasair rangehood and a Miele dishwasher that automatically opens when the cycle is complete to ensure complete dry - genius!
Luxurious fittings and fixtures extend to the bathrooms also, featuring highly regarded names such Villeroy and Boch, Grohe and Kado Lux.
Double-glazing throughout, zoned reverse-cycle heating and cooling and a Jetmaster gaslog fire provide for year-round quiet comfort.

connewarre-vic-3227,7 Caudry Street Highton VIC 3216,"Downsize without compromise!
It's not often single level homes with flat backyards come up in this part of Highton, so this one is sure to be popular - particularly with those whose knees and hips aren't what they used to be!
Cleverly positioned at the front of this custom home, your master bedroom includes a Jack and Jill WIR, dual vanity ensuite with oversized shower and separate toilet - like it should be. The adjacent lounge is a great breakout space when you need some 'me time', while the large study is ideal for - let's be serious, most of us right now - to work from home.
Hardwood timber flooring leads you down the hallway to the open-plan kitchen, dining and living enjoying the benefits of both the rising and falling sun. The positioning of the large island bench makes for a great command-post whether you're preparing meals or entertaining. Two sets of sliding doors extend the space onto the alfresco, which is complete with glass balustrade and quality outdoor blinds providing for all weather use (and protection from the prevailing Westerly!).
The other two large bedrooms each have built-in robes and desks, perfect for kids of all ages. They share a central bathroom and separate toilet.
There's heaps of storage inside the home, while the oversized garage easily accommodates two large cars and all your other 'stuff'. A rear roller door to the garage means you can tuck the trailer or bikes away safely.
The north-facing flat backyard is heaven for your babies, be they two or four-legged. Choose whether to set and forget with the low maintenance garden or bring out the inner green thumb.
A reminder that inspections are now by appointment only - call now to avoid disappointment!
