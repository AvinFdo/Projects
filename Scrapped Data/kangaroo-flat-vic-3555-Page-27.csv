kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,40 Howell Crescent Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Homely Haven on Howell
In a lovely elevated position, 40 Howell Crescent offers a well maintained 3-bedroom home on a manageable 658sqm allotment among other desirable homes in a fantastic location.
This property is suitable for a broad range of buyers - families, investors, first home buyers and retirees. Enjoy the accessibility of being within walking distance to schools, childcare, public transport, sporting complexes, parks and entertainment.
Upon arrival you'll notice the neat and easy care front garden with established trees, full garden beds and pebbles in-lieu of lawn to reduce mowing.
The main living room is light filled; capturing the morning sun and is quite a good size. It leads through to the open plan kitchen, meals and small family area. The kitchen offers a 4-burner gas cooktop, electric wall oven and grill, pantry and a breakfast bar. This space has two sliding doors - one leads to the carport and the other to the entertainment deck.
An ensuite, large built-in robe and a ceiling fan are features of the main bedroom. The 3-piece family bathroom and adjoining toilet are conveniently located near the remaining 2 bedrooms, which both have built-in robes. The laundry has external access with a concrete path that leads straight to the clothesline.
There is ducted gas heating and evaporative cooling to keep the temperature comfortable year-round. Most of the windows have canvas awnings, which assists in keeping the house cooler in the summer months.
The double carport has a gate to close the cars in - also handy for keeping kids and pets safely enclosed in the yard. The timber entertainment deck offers a lovely spot to sit and take in the views. The gardens have been cared for over the years and contain fruit trees, flowering trees and a spot to plant seasonal veggies. The 4m x 4m shed has a concrete floor, power and lights and there's also a handy 2m x 2m garden shed.
The position of this property is perfect - a lovely area on the Melbourne side of Bendigo. Inspections are most welcome so call today to arrange a viewing.
