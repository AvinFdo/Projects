coronet-bay-vic-3984,1250 Bass Highway Grantville VIC 3984,"PARADISE FOUND WITH DIRECT BEACH ACCESS
AUCTION 18TH MARCH 2017 11AM UNLESS SOLD PRIOR
Offered for the first time in 27 years this spectacular property on approximately 8 acres is available to a lucky purchaser.
Absolutely private the long entrance leads to a circular driveway and a very charming mud brick home surrounded by greenery and wildlife equivalent to a private sanctuary.
The three bedroom home boasts plenty of character featuring large windows, timber structures, high ceilings, an open fireplace and a loving feel throughout.
A hidden, unique surprise is an original Melbourne train parked at the property and would be the most exciting project. Boasting so many original features the train could be restored to its former glory and perhaps become guest accommodation or pursue multiple needs that would satisfy your imagination
It is hard to say what is the strongest highlight of this property but some would agree that the walking track with direct beach access to Westernport Bay is extremely rare and highly sought after.
Further improvements include shedding, an abundance of fruit trees and a healthy veggie patch.
Welcome to inspect 1250 Bass Highway, Grantville, your own paradise within 45 min of Melbourneâ??s Eastern suburbs.","SOLD - $706,000","3
