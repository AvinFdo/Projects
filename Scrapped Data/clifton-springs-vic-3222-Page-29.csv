Tucked in quiet court is this home that is looking for someone to accept the challenge and enjoy the process of putting their own stamp on a home that has good bones to start with.
The warmth of timber throughout, rural views from a large veranda. I admit things need doing but the potential is ongoing just bring your paint brush. Room for the Tradie to park a trailer, or the caravan and boat.
Ample under house storage. A drive by will not do this home justice so can I encourage you to arrange a time to view.
What can this suburb offer you? All the amenities for day to day life are close by. Recreation and relaxation are all covered too, golf, fishing, riding, walking etc. All the great living that the Bellarine has to offer.","SOLD - $402,000","4
