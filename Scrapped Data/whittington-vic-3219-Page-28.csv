French doors open to a verandah and alfresco deck thats ideal for outdoor living and entertaining. A stunning and unique feature of this residence is the 3x6 metre sandstone basement cellar.
Surrounded by a manicured hedged garden and century-old trees, outdoor features include an original coach house and stables, minor sheds, vegetable gardens, childrens play area, original Chasselas grapevine and 50,000 litres of water storage.
With a bus stop to private schools directly outside the property, easy access to Highton Village shops and cafes, Geelong CBD and the Surf Coast, and one hour to Melbourne CBD via the Ring Road, Neuchatel is ideally located to maximise all the benefits of country living, while being close to amenities.
