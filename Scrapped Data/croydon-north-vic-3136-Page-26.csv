Perched on a huge block 1468m2 block (approx.), this property marks a new opportunity for developers looking for their next challenge to reinvent the property wheel; recreating a huge block that has been well loved by the same family since it was built, and now it's come time for new beginnings. You'll think all your Christmas' have come at once. First time offered to the market, the interior has been updated with a modernised kitchen, whist also presenting a spa family bathroom, three big bedrooms a main living room.
Moving forward, the option to sub divide and renovate the existing home is a possibility, otherwise the option to redevelop the entire site would mean another group of new, low maintenance homes in the street. Surrounding properties lead the example of redevelopment, encouraging a variety of buyers in the area, including first home owners, downsizers and investors. Within a short walk to North Croydon shopping village, the property also provides ducted heating, air conditioning, a detached double garage and garden shed, and 16 solar panels. Note: All building works are Subject To Council Approval (STCA).","SOLD - $700,000","3
