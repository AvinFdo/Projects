connewarre-vic-3227,5 Lambhill Crescent Highton VIC 3216,"Mid-Century Marvel on 700sqm
So much of Highton's most tightly held real estate is hidden away amongst leafy green surrounds yet central to all of the action and this magnificent mid-century residence is a testament to exceptional craftsmanship and quality of lifestyle.
Constructed in the early 60's on the low-side of the street with all the original tastes of the era, the property offers multiple living zones, well sized accommodation and a warm flowing ambience throughout that you'll simply fall head over heels for. The north-facing frontage drives in that desirable sunshine to the bedrooms and living zones and truly sets the tone.
The potential for renovation, extension, rebuild/development are all fantastic options given the size of your allotment and orientation although it would be a shame to see the character of this home leave the streetscape.
Back to location, make no mistake that this is as good as it gets for the growing family. Walking distance to multiple bus stops, Montpellier Primary School and the North Valley Road shops and Highton Village within easy reach.
This is a truly exceptional opportunity to acquire a chip off the best block in this charming Highton pocket - don't hold back, contact today to book your private inspection!","SOLD - $612,000","3
