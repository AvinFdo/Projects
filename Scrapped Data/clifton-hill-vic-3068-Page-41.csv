*** This property is available for inspection by appointment - Please contact us to arrange a suitable time ***
Architecturally renovated and extended to the highest standards, this exquisite, 4 bedroom + study Californian Bungalow has faithfully preserved the home's considerable original charms, merging them with a remarkable open-plan rear and a superb al fresco flow. A symphony of space and light, the home is designed for visual impact, wonderful functionality and proud home entertaining.
Every detail has been considered in this home that flows from the traditional to the contemporary with minimal fuss. At its heart, a vast open-plan kitchen / meals overlooks a broad family living room with incredible ease. A central, stone-topped and waterfall-edged island bench provides a welcoming place to gather, whilst a suite of SMEG and Bosch appliances cater beautifully to gourmet cooks. French Doors open seamlessly to a generous, paved and split-level backyard that promises relaxing and sun-dappled al fresco entertaining.
Upstairs, an impressively-sized master bedroom is an indulgent retreat in which a 5 star ensuite is fully-tiled with a floating wall-mounted double-basin vanity, plus there are walk-in robes, a generous study and plenty of storage in a cleverly adapted roof cavity. Indeed, each of the bedrooms are also equipped with excellent robe storage - one also with another ensuite.
Additional features include a 3rd fully-tiled bathroom, a powder room and a brilliant double garage that has been converted to a rumpus / play room and from which glass sliding doors provide a seamless connection to the outdoor living area. Meanwhile, an alarm system offers peace-of-mind whilst ducted heating and evaporative cooling ensure year-round comfort.
An alluring blend of urban convenience and leafy tranquillity is the offer from this first class location near Fairfield shops and cafes, the Yarra River's parkland and trails as well as offering walkability to Fairfield or Alphington Railway Stations for easy city-commuting.
