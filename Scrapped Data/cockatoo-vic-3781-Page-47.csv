cockatoo-vic-3781,55 Station Road Gembrook VIC 3783,"Mudbrick Cottage with Views - subdivision potential!
*** ACCESS VIA HEROES AVENUE***
With Puffing Billy chugging past and beautiful valley and mountain views beyond, this cosy mudbrick cottage has plenty of potential. In a quiet, peaceful and sunny location. With 2 street frontages and set on just over 1100 m2 allotment the zoning allows for subdivision (subject to council approval of course) - a great opportunity or nest egg for the future. Currently the home consists of an open plan beamed living and dining room, warmed by a gas log fire. Rear deck and side courtyard, a lovely sunny flat lawn area, perfect place to soak up the spring sunshine. Also 3 bedrooms, serviceable kitchen with upright stove, adjoining laundry, also separate WC and bathroom. Just a short stroll into town, the IGA, cafes and speciality shops, the bus stop and just minutes to the local primary school.
A great first home buyers project, bring your imagination, some tools and roll your sleeves up to create your own piece of mudbrick magic! Call Mick Dolphin 0429 684 522 or Janet Hawkins 0409 117 432 to show you through.
