croydon-south-vic-3136,30 Blazey Road CROYDON SOUTH VIC 3136,"MODERN FAMILY HOME
Nestled in a leafy part of beautiful Croydon South and just a short walk from the primary school and Eastfield Park is this beautiful family home. Featuring 4 large, fully robed bedrooms with a full ensuite to the master this is the home to lay down your roots. Once you get over the huge modern kitchen and two generous living areas you begin to notice how bright and modern this renovated home, with its north facing rear yard truly is.
Enough about the home itself, step outside onto this private (approx 911m2) block either through the picturesque covered deck or drive straight through your solid brick double lockup garage with rear access. While the kids throw the footy around dad (or mum) can lock themselves in the fully lit and powered workshop.
With parks, schools (public and private), great access to buses and Ringwood East Station, with Eastlink just down the road, make the decision to view this home today, because it'll probably be sold tomorrow.
