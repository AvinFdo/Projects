This spectacular bespoke residence delivers on every expectation, offering lavish proportions across two ingeniously considered and masterfully executed levels.
Only twelve months old, this stunning premium home celebrates contemporary design. From the attractive partially-rendered façade through to spacious interiors, natural light sweeps through the open-plan living space where a combination of high ceilings, crisp tones and clean lines are cleverly showcased.
Dedicated to exemplary family living and entertaining, Tassie Oak floorboards introduce an organic warmth and balance in the living space downstairs where double doors can be folded back to create a seamless connection between indoor and outdoor living. The rear landscaped courtyard is easy to manage and offers a tranquil backdrop for summer dining.
The Smeg kitchen is as beautiful as it is practical, comprising; electric oven, gas stove and dishwasher. A stunning stone waterfall island benchtop sits in the centre, adding extra space for cooking, as well as acting as a breakfast bar. Pendant lighting creates a chic finish over the island bench while the built-in microwave and veggie mixer help to save time. Abundant soft-close drawers and cupboard space have been employed in order to maintain an uncluttered work space.
The ingenious layout places the master on the lower level - an appreciable benefit whether you're a family, executive couple, retiree or those looking to downsize. Luxury and ease are experienced every day, comprising a fitted walk-in robe and full ensuite enjoying a walk-in rain shower with dual shower head, soft-close drawers and square profile tapware.

Positioned off a central living area, two sizable bedrooms are fitted with double-built in robes and the fourth bedroom with a walk-in robe. The bathroom reflects the same quality and look as the ensuite, featuring a semi-frameless rain shower, separate bath and stylish vanity.
Undeniably exuding premium quality and styling throughout, the home lists; highly-functional laundry, powder room, split system heating and cooling in all four bedrooms and living zones (six units throughout), square-set plastering, quality carpet, dual roller blinds, LED lights, storage, touch-screen security alarm system, data points, water tank (plumbed to toilets), shed, remote double garage with internal and rear access and extra parking.

croydon-south-vic-3136,6 Mariana Avenue Croydon South VIC 3136,"Surprisingly modern beyond classic exterior.
SALE BY SET DATE Thursday 20th September at 6pm
Radiating timeless charm, this character weatherboard will inspire you with classic light-filled interiors which effortlessly meld with modern conveniences that together promise a home of unyielding comfort and ease.
Gracefully poised on an 837m2 (approx.) block and set amid a tranquil established garden, a front patio offers a welcoming entry into the home as well as providing serene views towards the Dandenongs, equally enjoyable from the spacious lounge where French doors grant immediate access to the patio. A combination of abundant windows furnished with Roman blinds, high ceilings and warm neutral tones create a remarkable sense of homeliness.
The large kitchen incorporates the dining area and is fully equipped with stainless steel appliances; electric oven and two-drawer dishwasher, gas stove, ample cupboards and bench space. French doors open up to a covered outdoor entertaining area which overlooks the tranquil backyard.
The bright, robed master bedroom evokes a sense of calm, boasting yet another set of French doors that open up to the rear deck. Plantation shutters introduce subtle sophistication while the mood shifts tremendously when entering the ultra-modern full ensuite showcasing a luxurious walk-in rain shower and stylish wall-hung vanity boasting a broad, single soft-close drawer. The adoption of awarding winning Methven tapware, sleek towel rack and deep-toned floor-to-wall tiles result in a five-star hotel feel.
An impressive collaboration has been achieved with clean lines and sleek materials used in the on-trend bathroom. Above all, the inspiring spatial arrangement is key to the design. Boasting a day-spa feel, relaxation and rejuvenation comes with complements of a deep-soak bath and frameless rain shower with wall niche. The bathroom reflects the same exquisite décor as the ensuite. The addition of a skylight floods the space with natural light.
Other highlights include; gas ducted heating, split system air-conditioning (three units), built-in robes to all bedrooms, double linen cupboard, canvas awnings, under-house storage, shed, single carport and ample off-street parking.
This address places the occupants just a brief walk from The Mall shopping strip, Cheong Park with barbeque area and playground, Pinjarra Kindergarten, Tinternvale Primary School, Tintern Grammar, Maroondah Hospital, bus stop, as well as being only a short commute from Ringwood East Railway Station, Burnt Bridge Shopping Centre, EastLink freeway, Aquinas College, bicycle tracks and golf courses.
