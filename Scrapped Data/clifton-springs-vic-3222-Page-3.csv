clifton-springs-vic-3222,27 Coolabah Way Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"READY FOR YOUR STAMP
""State Government now permitting public OFI's for groups of 20 people, social distancing still applies""
In real estate we often use words like ""blank canvas"" ""ready for your own personal stamp"" Well this property is exactly that. The paint is hardly dry and the smell of new carpet hits your nostrils as you walk inside but the rest of the home needs finishing off. Move in and take your time. A neat compact but not pokey home which comprises three bedrooms, one bathroom and single garage. On a corner site which often appeals to the boat or caravan owner to have side access.
This home would suit someone buying into the market for their first home, an investor or a downsizer who likes the idea of a smaller home and a garden to play in. The outside truly is a blank canvas. Veggie patches, flowers, trees or bushes all totally up to you.
Why not come along and take a look? Clifton springs is a suburb of choice because of its affordability and the lifestyle it offers. Walking, riding, fishing, golfing, eating and drinking are all right here.","SOLD - $430,000","3
