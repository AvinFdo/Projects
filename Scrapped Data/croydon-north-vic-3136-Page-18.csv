croydon-north-vic-3136,8/25 Karingal Street Croydon North VIC 3136,"SPACIOUS LIVING, INSIDE AND OUT
Positioned at the rear of an established development, this single-level unit was the first to be purchased off the plan and has been solely owner-occupied since. Perfect for downsizers and first homebuyers, the layout is surprisingly spacious, comprising 2 bedrooms with built-in robes and a big, bright bathroom.
The carpeted living room is accompanied by a separate dining area, which would make an ideal study or 3rd bedroom, adjoining a generous open plan meals area with a wood heater and reverse cycle split system. A gas-appointed kitchen features a stainless steel dishwasher and additional timber cabinetry, complementing plenty of storage throughout.
Outside, an entertaining deck has a pitched roof pergola, stepping down to the fully-paved backyard with a garden shed. Immaculately presented, this private and low-maintenance home is complete with gas heating, ceiling fans, skylights, a single garage and an additional car space.
In cul-de-sac culminating in parklands, you’ll enjoy nearby buses and Croydon North shops, post office and cafes, close to the Village School and Chirnside Park shopping centre.
