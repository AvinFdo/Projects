Attention Developers, Investors and Builders, are you looking for your next project? You could build 6 new units (STCA) on this premium block of approx. 1810 sqm. It's in a superb location, close to childcare, schools, transport and shops. Privately set back from the highway, with easy access via the service road, the existing 3 bedroom 2 bathroom weatherboard home has seen better days and is ready for you to knock down.
Water and gas are connected. This fantastic block is nestled in a picturesque, treed pocket highly sought by families and homebuyers near Bonnie View Rd and the beautiful Warrien Reserve. The childcare centre is right next door, while kindergarten and a host of quality government and private schools are nearby, including: Luther College, Yarra Valley Grammar, Village Primary School, Croydon Hills Primary, Good Shepherd Lutheran Primary and Oxley College. Croydon North Plaza is the local shopping strip, and you're only minutes from McAdam Square shops, Croydon Central, Eastland and Chirnside shopping.
Bus stop is near the corner, Croydon station is handy, and it's an easy 30 minute (approx.) commute to the CBD or beach on EastLink. Drive 30 minutes (approx.) the other way along the highway and you'll find the delights of the Yarra Valley. This is an outstanding opportunity on more than 1/3 acre - you'll need to be quick.

croydon-north-vic-3136,6 Ambon Rise CROYDON NORTH VIC 3136,"BALI BEAUTIFUL
From the tropics of beautiful Bali, to a backyard setting that takes you back there, this inspiring home is blissful, inviting and has that little something special about it. Inside maintains its family character, splashing around with warm hues, high ceilings and a combination of carpets in the formal lounge room and the natural appeal of Hardwood timber floors in the dining room and in the family/meals area. There are 3 or 4 bedrooms, of which one can easily be utilised as a study or 4th bedroom. A huge walk in robe and en suite bathroom gives an element of surprise with its expansive proportions; it's a haven away from the rest of the home, fitted with a corner spa bath, separate shower and vanity. The family bathroom is spotlessly presented with a shower, bath and separate 2nd toilet. When finding your inner goddess, there's all the creature comforts in the kitchen to make cooking or entertaining enjoyable, including stainless steel appliances, a dishwasher, glass splash-backs and a modern impression. Taking the traditional Balinese style of incorporating wood into their outdoor settings, the huge entertaining area in the backyard is built with high pitched ceilings, beautiful timber flooring, a 8pp spa with an inbuilt TV and lush tropical plantations to complete the intended picture. Furthermore, the location is just as an impressive highlight, set in a court, and is close to quality schools, McAdam shops and bus services. Extras include: ducted heating, AC, garden sheds and a double garage.","SOLD - $557,000","4
