curlewis-vic-3222,61-69 Navarre Road Curlewis VIC 3222,"Rural Getaway on The Bellarine
At the end of the tree lined drive, past a small planting of pinot noir vines sits a light filled, mid-century modern style, well proportioned, 3 bedroom family home. Beautifully situated on 1.2ha, with views onto neighbouring vineyards, this residence offers generous family living with zoned spaces together with an enviable garden and entertaining area overlooking the pool.
The first of 2 living spaces has a stunning wood fire and large windows with views to the garden. Timber beamed ceilings and slate flooring in the entrance and throughout the home adds texture and durability and there is plenty of storage on offer here. The well laid out kitchen has plenty of room to move and a large bench that overlooks the adjoining dining area. There is a laundry with handy access to outside and family bathroom with shower and toilet converts to a powder room for guests.
The second family room is a flexible space that leads to the courtyard and pool. There’s an extra room with folding doors here that could be an ideal study, home office, playroom or guest accommodation. Two bedrooms, both with BIRs and garden views are located at the same end of the house to complete a family wing. The master suite is at the front of the home, away from the noise of the kids and guests! Complete with an ensuite and WIR, this bedroom has a lovely view onto the vineyard and is a peaceful retreat.
Across 1.2ha, this property has beautiful gardens, large sheds and a fabulous entertaining area focused around a pool and spa. The pool house, located off the bricked courtyard is a great space for summer dining and catching some relief from the hot summer sun. Nearby, the grassed area in front of the vineyard offers a great place for kids play and the potential for extending the planting.
A fantastic rural location that is close to beaches, shops and golf clubs, this property is an incredible opportunity to realise your rural Bellarine dream.","SOLD - $950,000","3
