cockatoo-vic-3781,14 Dunstan Road Avonsleigh VIC 3782,"Dream Starter!
Every now and then you come across a house that really feels like home. And this is it.
This home sits proudly on a generous 1/4 acre in the natural Avonsleigh surrounds with views into the hills of Wright's forest.
The front of the home features a generous veranda where you can sit and listen to the sounds of wildlife in the sunshine over your morning coffee.
The double colonial style sliding front doors welcome you into the light filled home with comfortable carpeted lounge room and neutral colour scheme. Beyond the lounge is a functional kitchen with plenty of bench space and adjoining dining area with windows that let the light in and provide views over the rear yard and into the distance.
The bedrooms, 2 with built in robes, are located along the hallway and serviced by the large main bathroom. The laundry is cleverly tucked away behind double doors in a contemporary European style.
There is also a study with stunning views that will inspire you to work or study hard to be your best, without the stress.
From the study is an exit that takes you onto a spacious covered timber deck with bistro blinds; the perfect place for entertaining with family and friends, watching the little ones play or just watching the continuous display of life thriving everywhere in such a majestic place.
The land is punctuated with tree ferns and native shrubs to encourage wildlife, and a healthy, maintained gum tree in the middle of the rear yard that is the envy of the town.
The home also features gas ducted heating, air conditioner, single lock up garage, single carport and garden shed.
Everything about this house feels like a home. Don't miss the opportunity to view.

***AVAILABLE FOR VIEWING BY PRIVATE INSPECTION. CONTACT AARON DAY 0407 365 994 OR TYSON BLUHM 0437 843 820
For sale is this ideal family home in a quiet court location of Gembrook. Just an easy stroll to schools, shops, restaurants and public transport, this impeccably styled home makes living a breeze.
The sealed driveway and remote double garage provides comfortable car accommodation and has access directly into the home, onto a tiled hallway floor.
The open hallway begins at the front door where the spacious master bedroom is located, complete with well finished ensuite and good sized walk in robe.
Farther down the hallway and adjacent to the master, is the informal living area, reading room, office or spare bedroom with excellent natural light from the large windows.
The hallway then diverges into the main living zone featuring open plan kitchen, dining and lounge area.
The kitchen has an abundance of cupboard and bench space plus an island bench, and the dark tops provide a pleasing contrast to the white cabinetry and grey tiles.
There is a breakfast bar for informal dining, plus the adjoining dedicated space for a more formal meal. The lounge area is quality carpeted in a dark grey scheme, offsetting the lighter colours of the walls and tiles, and features windows that look over the secure rear yard.
Zoned away from the master are the remaining 2 bedrooms with built in robes, large main bathroom, laundry and separate toilet.
There is an additional undercover entertaining deck accessed from the dining area which is large enough for serving meals with friends and family on weekends.
The backyard is fully fenced and spacious so the family friendly game of backyard cricket can continue at Christmas.
Other features of the home include gas ducted heating, gas solar hot water & reverse cycle split system.
This home has all the comforts, designed for the growing family but equally comfortable for the childless couple or singles with family and friends that like to come and stay.
Houses of this calibre, with interest rates this low simply do not stay on the market for long.

cockatoo-vic-3781,9 Prince Street Emerald VIC 3782,"EASY LIKE SUNDAY MORNING
Just the thing you were hoping would appear on the market, a 3-bedroom family home already renovated in an up to the minute style. Close to everything Emerald has to offer but hidden away on a private and quiet street amongst the gums. With nothing left to worry about you can move straight in and relax.
A fashionable monochrome colour spectrum has been deployed throughout giving the house an effortless appeal culminating in the shiny black spacious kitchen and adjoining dining room. The living area with split system features a large window looking out to the modern landscaping favouring yuccas and native grasses. The bathroom is white and bright and there is a separate toilet, laundry and loads of storage space so you can keep the lines clear and clutter-free.
The flat and fully fenced area immediately surrounding the house is brick paved and undercover front and back. It is a total winner for those with little children who can get outside and ride their trikes no matter what the weather. It is also a marvellous space indeed for entertaining (subject to restriction level!), whether under the cover or on the upper wooden terrace where you can watch the sunset over the ridge or feed the native birds.
The 2700m2 (approx) block also offers a double garage, double carport and a further shed and mature lemon, lime and olive trees.

cockatoo-vic-3781,28 Elm Crescent Emerald VIC 3782,"Cedar Shingled Heart String Puller
Get ready to fall in love with your new home - the epitome of everything that beckons you to the hills: quirk, cosiness, character, views, a sense of space and, so important in this day and age; seclusion. Located near the old Emerald heritage golf course, an area famous for its European spring & autumn foliage that attracted city folk around the 1900's. Elm Crescent is one of a cluster of streets established around that time and holiday homes were built on the hillside, looking north across the Yarra Valley to the Warburton Ranges.
The home itself is Swiss Family Robinson meets fairytale castle meets English Homes & Garden interior magazine. So many beautiful places and windows to admire the view from and soak in that northerly light and that vitamin D3. Spread over two levels, there are lots of nooks and crannies to get creative with zoning and furnishing. The lounge, off the main open plan meals/living/dining, is a snuggle-heaven. The kitchen, while small, is practical and has potential to improve. A handy downstairs powder room incorporates the laundry.
Upstairs, past the first landing with access to the rear garden, the 2nd story greets you with a landing pad into all the bedrooms and main bathroom. The bedrooms comprise; one decent double, one perfect as a nursery/guest or study, the master with en-suite and a gigantic kid's/teen's/twenty-something's bedroom with play area/hang-out/dressing-room. The upstairs balcony provides even more panoramic scenery and is accessible from 3 of the bedrooms.
Lots of landscaped garden outdoor areas including the stunning front deck and side covered area as well as approx 1000m2 of paddock at the rear of the property waiting for a pony or some landscape design vision.

cockatoo-vic-3781,69 Williamson Road Gembrook VIC 3783,"Stunning 4 Bedroom + Studio on a Fantastic Block!
Conveniently located only 5 minutes drive to the Gembrook township, this stunningly renovated 4 bedroom home is a dream come true.
Set on almost 2/3 acre, the home invites you onto the front timber deck with feature planter box, inferring a quality that continues throughout the entire home.
Stepping into the living area you are immediately struck by the dark feature wall and contrasting floating floor which gives the room an atmosphere of warmth, championed by the large wood heater in the corner, making those chilly evenings a delight. The addition of a split system air conditioner keeps you cool in the summer so the family is comfortable all year round.
The huge master bedroom, zoned away from the other bedrooms, has massive built in robes and equally large ensuite which is both functional and aesthetic.
The living room diverges into the equally striking kitchen, where the light dances around the room with white cupboards, stainless steel appliances and white bench tops with bold red splash back tiles that achieve a gorgeous contrast.
The kitchen bench also serves as a breakfast bar into the adjoining dining area which is just as spacious and bright with a large window and double glass sliding doors.
The remaining bedrooms are all carpeted and robed and serviced by the main bathroom and separate toilet.
Accessed from both the meals area and living room, the river red timber entertaining deck is spacious and looks over the entire rear yard. The roof is insulated and has panels that allow the light to diffuse through without the heat.
Another attractive aspect of this property is the addition of a delightfully renovated bungalow which makes working from home not only easy, but enjoyable. Alternatively, use it as a teenagers retreat or home for aging parents.
There is a huge triple lock up garage with electric roller doors and enough room for a work shop and a cubby for the kids so everyones needs are taken care of.
Finally, this home is cheap to run with a massive 4 kW solar unit!
This property is a real delight and feels like home. Make an inquiry to secure your inspection today!

cockatoo-vic-3781,Emerald VIC 3782,"Porte de Bleu A Garden Lovers Paradise
PRIVATE INSPECTIONS AVAILABLE ADHERING TO HYGIENE & SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES
An Australian masterpiece designed by Alistair Knox in 1978 close to shops, sporting facilities, schools and the cafe culture of Emerald, this family home is a triumph of reclaimed materials and environment harnessed to create a thermally efficient house full of beauty and whimsy. The house is built from mud bricks made on-site, complemented by recycled Oregon timbers and rustic brick floors. It sits peacefully and privately within covetable established gardens full of rare plants and artfully created mise en scène.
This home is jam-packed with passive house design features. The north-facing windows welcome the sun during the winter months and as the equinox arrives the home is shaded from the harsh summer heat. The signature Knox fireplace uses both radiant heat and convection ensuring the heat energy is retained and circulated. The chimney creates a heat bank that radiates warmth for hours. All of these factors combine to make the house naturally 5 - 10 degrees warmer or cooler depending on the season.
The kitchen blends the best of old and new with recent red cupboard doors and a converted gas Aga for real country hospitality as well as a 900 conventional freestanding gas cooker. Fanciful windows of salvaged leadlight have been used throughout the house, in the doors, the bathrooms, the cupboards, even in the woodshed! Wherever you look there is warmth and character built-in. The master bedroom enjoys a view of the exquisite garden as does every window in the house.
Step through the eponymous blue door and be transported into the art trail of a garden that feels endless and without effort - roses tumble over archways, meandering garden paths, a bridge that completes Monets Garden tableaux. Set amongst the bigger picture, you will find a more practical kitchen garden with chook shed or dog run, fruit and nut trees that include quince, lemons, limes, cherries, apples, pears, and kiwis. All nourished by 20,000 litres of tank water that supplies 1km of irrigation. With an option to tap into main water as well.
This house & garden is extraordinary. For a private tour please contact Katie Woods on 0428 744 498.","SOLD - $935,000","4
