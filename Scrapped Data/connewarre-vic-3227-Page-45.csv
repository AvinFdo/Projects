connewarre-vic-3227,2 Parkview Court Grovedale VIC 3216,"The Perfect Package On Parkview!
Situated on a large 677m2 allotment in a quiet court here is a wonderful opportunity to secure a very tidy three bedroom home with some very appealing extra features which separate it ""from the pack"". The dual concrete paved driveways, cavernous covered outdoor living area, stylish kitchen renovation and rumpus/bungalow at the rear of the property all combine to make the perfect house for those who seek some style with practicality. 
From the street view the newly constructed high wooden fence gives instant appeal and privacy to the property. With dual access points and driveways on both sides, storing a trailer, caravan or boat a breeze without imposing on your day to day car access needs.
Walk into the home to discover three well sized bedrooms with built in robes and split system in the master. New carpet throughout pleases the eye immediately. The spacious living is at the rear of the house adjacent to the stylishly renovated kitchen and dining area. Polished concrete floors and subway kitchen wall tiles define this area with a very contemporary touch. Plenty of cupboard space and a dishwasher feature in the kitchen. A gas wall heater in the living and cooling unit in the dining cater for all temperatures. Step outside to a truly magnificent covered outdoor living area. Entertaining will be a treat in this vast space and the stone filled extended yard ensures the property is an attractive but low maintenance affair. A bungalow/rumpus on the northern rear side will make the perfect hobby/gym or storage room. A split system also adorns this room. Behind this is even more storage space with a garden shed.
With Hansen Reserve immediately next door and Grovedale Recreation Reserve only a short stroll away taking the kids for a play in the park and dog for a walk is no problem. With quick access onto Torquay Rd the Surf Coast is only a short drive away while all amenities are all catered for with nearby Heyers Rd Shops and to a larger extent at Waurn Ponds Shopping Centre. The current owners are also happy to stay on as tenants for any interested investor. Hurry to get the perfect package!","SOLD - $494,000","3

connewarre-vic-3227,26 Pepperdine Way Highton VIC 3216,"Blue-chip Old Highton, New Build
Set high upon the hill in one of Highton's most desirable pockets, there's nothing left to do in this magnificent newly built home.
Leave your worries at the front door and feel the overwhelming sense of calm created by the perfect balance of contemporary quality and detailed features.
GROUND LEVEL
Your sumptuous master suite is cleverly located at the front of the home, well away from the other bedrooms upstairs - just perfect for those with teenage kids or older. You'll love the large WIR, but it's the in-floor heating of your dual vanity ensuite that will become something you simply can't live without!
Head down the hall and on your right you'll find a powder room, multiple linen closets and a great sized laundry with even more storage. To your left, one of the three living spaces; this one complete with gaslog fire. Continue on through to the incredible open-plan living at the rear and see where the magic really happens! Stone benchtops, shaker style cabinetry, dual ovens and a butler's pantry make the kitchen a dream to work in and provide a perfect vantage point over the adjacent dining and living. Sunlight fills this north-facing room beautifully, while stacker doors extend the space onto the alfresco and flat backyard. Entertaining and family were clearly at the forefront of the design of this home.
UPPER LEVEL
Head upstairs and you'll find a large family room which is perfect breakout space for the kids. Three additional bedrooms all have BIR and share a central bathroom with not just a separate toilet, but a full powder room - ensuring guests don't have to brave going into the kids' bathroom!
If you're feeling uncertain about the market, answer this - do you want to buy your dream home while there are less people looking or when everyone else is buying again!?
