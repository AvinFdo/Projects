collingwood-vic-3066,72 Gold Street COLLINGWOOD VIC 3066,"SPACE, COMFORT AND COLLINGWOOD HISTORY
This wide block-fronted residence, built in 1917, is next door to the birthplace of the legendary John Wren, whose first betting business was centred around Gold Street and the adjacent laneways. A wide hallway opens from the front verandah to three exceptionally spacious and well-lit bedrooms. Double doors lead to the well-proportioned living and dining room, open to a modern kitchen with polished concrete floors. To one side is a good-sized bathroom, with free standing clawfoot bath and separate shower, and a laundry recess. Timber and glass folding doors open to a pergola and bluestone paved courtyard to two sides. Featuring timber floorboards and reverse-cycle air conditioning, here is a sunny family home providing comfortable living for many years to come, with potential to add further value in a rapidly appreciating precinct close to cafes, transport and freeway access.

collingwood-vic-3066,10 Bendigo St Collingwood VIC 3066,"Executor's Auction
This contemporary two storey freestanding townhouse on a wider than normal allotment may abut Hoddle Street at the rear but at an entry level price you'll get a lot of house for a reasonable price. There's two bedrooms with robes upstairs where the main with a bit of work could possibly be made in to two rooms and an open plan living area with meals adjoining kitchen.
Ample glass doors and windows abound to allow natural light to stream through the home and provide a vista across the front and rear paved yards. Presented in a very comfortable and honest manner this property will enable you to move in or lease today whilst considering improvements for the future.
We're sure you'll see that the attributes of this home outweigh the minor inconvenience of being adjacent Hoddle Street","SOLD - $568,000","2
