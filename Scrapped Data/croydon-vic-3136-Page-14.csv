croydon-vic-3136,11/56 Norton Road Croydon VIC 3136,"Neat unit in the heart of Croydon.
Positioned within walking distance to Croydon Central offering a full range of amenities with Swinburne TAFE only steps away, shops, cafes, railway station and tranquil parks, this desirable brick-veneer home is quietly set back from the road and presents a superb opportunity for the first-home buyer, investor, downsizer or retiree.
Occupying a generous 294m2 (approx.) block and greeted by an appealing portico entry, step inside and be surprised by the homely interior. The lounge feels comfortable and relaxed, further enhanced with lashings of natural light entering through the large window.
The spacious kitchen provides everything you need and is a pleasure to work in. Eye-catching stainless steel appliances include an electric oven and gas stove, while the De'Longhi dishwasher is an appreciable benefit. The tiled splashback adds practicality to the space, in addition to ample storage and benchtops which make cooking a breeze. Furthermore, the sizable adjoining dining area connects with the paved outdoor entertaining zone through double glass doors.
The master features a walk-in robe and ensuite-effect bathroom incorporating a bath, shower and separate toilet. Bedroom two comprises a double built-in robe while bedroom three is fitted with double sliding doors to open up the space if required.
Offering a full-sized laundry, this delightful home also features linen and storage cupboards, gas ducted heating, remote-entry single garage with internal access and visitor parking out front. The secure backyard is above average in size for a unit while still being low in maintenance, offering a remarkable opportunity to spend time outdoors.

Positioned at the rear of a beautifully presented complex, everything you need is right here.","SOLD - $595,000","3

Perfect timing for your enjoyment this summer is this charming weatherboard highlighting wonderful outdoor entertaining spaces and engaging gardens that are shaded by a stunning Golden Elm in the front yard. Occupying a corner block, approx. 1000m2, and so close to Croydon shops and the train station, driving the car may become a rarity. In addition is the convenience of Aqua Hub gym and the indoor pool, the local library and council, the Croydon outdoor pool as well as Arndale shops in one direction and Croydon Central shops on Kent Avenue in the other. All within a short walk. Add to that list are nearby schools, including Swinburne Tafe, and multiple medical facilities on the way to Eastland or to access the freeway, including Ringwood private and Maroondah hospitals. Originally built in the 1930s, the home maintains traditional features including high decorative ceilings, fret work, wood work including the original floorboards, and ornate light fittings. Tastefully enhanced along the way, the four bedroom floorplan combines yesteryear charm with modern necessity, offering a gas log fire in the formal lounge room, ducted heating throughout and evaporative cooling. Together with an inviting sun room which has the best garden views and natural sunlight in the home, a social dining room provides French door access to the back deck, and the family room is an added extra and provides a great space for kids to hang out or for entertaining. Both bathrooms are traditionally presented and the kitchen is a great space for everyday creations, featuring a French five burner stove and a dishwasher. Furthermore, this appealing residence features a double garage with remote roller door, gated driveway access, a water tank and landscaped gardens that encourage your attention to the outdoors.","SOLD - $900,000","4
