ormond-vic-3204,2 Ormond Road ORMOND VIC 3204,"Plus size block & big opportunity
Although it has done faithful service, this period, weatherboard, 2-bedroom-and-study home (with a separate lounge room and dining room) has probably passed its use-by date. On the other hand the plus-size allotment it occupies has definite appeal - particularly to dream home builders or developers (STCA). Land size of approx 846.16sqm (20.12m x 42.07m) speaks for itself - as does the quiet location in a tree-lined street near buses, schools, major access roads, recreation, local shops, cafes and trains, & within convenient distance to Monash Uni (Caulfield).

In Zone rear home living doesn't get bigger, better or more sun-filled than this! Offering genuine house-sized accommodation on virtually full-sized approx 640sqm private rear land, this three bedroom, two bathroom home is cleverly designed to offer superior single-level accommodation in lush north-facing lawned gardens.
Cleverly accommodating with two large north-facing living zones supplemented by a beautiful veranda-style al fresco zone, this well-designed home features separate bedroom zones - with a garden-view master-suite (with mirrored robe area and ensuite) plus secondary bedrooms in a quiet wing beside a skylit bathroom and separate WC.

Set behind pretty picket fencing with an auto-garage and turning-circle parking, even the location is superior with the back gate to McKinnon College within a coupe of blocks, the bus to Monash University and Chadstone around the corner and Ormond's shopping and station within three minutes' walk.","SOLD - $920,000","3
