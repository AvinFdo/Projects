clifton-hill-vic-3068,38D Greeves Street Fitzroy VIC 3065,"Live the High Life in this Fitzroy Jewel
***This property is available for inspection by appointment - Please contact us to arrange a suitable time***
This two story penthouse apartment high above Brunswick St is in a league of its own. Renovated in 2013 by award winning architects
Splinter Society, and located in Fitzroy's iconic Beswicke Terrace, it's a rare chance to buy into this boutique block of only four apartments located in the heritage part of the building. The master has huge ceilings, and is generous in both size and storage. Overlooking Brunswick St with a working fireplace, en-suite with separate toilet, and a double shower, this loft style bedroom is true luxury. The second toilet is completely stand alone, always good when having guests over. And the separate bathroom has a generous bath with shower above. The second bedroom is well sized with floor to ceiling cupboards, and a view towards Collingwood. The downstairs is completed with a cleverly hidden laundry, as well as a study nook. The upstairs living area is light and bright, with a unique glass floor panel and plenty of windows to take in the amazing view. Living, dining and kitchen are all combined in an open plan dynamic space with vaulted ceilings. A few steps lead you to the rooftop terrace, approximately 20m2 with panoramic views to the city, Carlton, Collingwood and beyond. Rising directly above Brunswick St, this view truly does need to be seen to be believed.
*** COVID-19 Announcement ***
If you're attending a Private Appointment, we request that you only attend if you are fit and healthy to do so and not under any self-isolation conditions. We request that you maintain a healthy distance from our team members, and if requested wait outside until the property is ready for the appointment.
