clunes-vic-3370,120 Fells Gully Road CLUNES VIC 3370,"‘Mirrengatta’: 27 hectares of tranquil bushland
This retreat is the stuff dreams are made of! Tucked away on the edge of a State forest natural bush reserve, here is a pristine landscape of towering eucalypts, rare native flora and open grassland which has never been farmed or grazed. ‘Mirrengatta’ has been justly extolled by a well known Ballarat field naturalist, birdwatcher & writer as ‘a Garden of Eden’. The land is home to wildflowers, indigenous orchids and native groundcovers; some 190 species of bird life are known to visit, along with black wallabies and black kangaroos. This remarkable property, which includes a large lake and a dam, has current planning permission for a residence/studio. Seize this seldom-found opportunity to build an ecologically sustainable weekender or permanent residence in a place of unspoilt natural beauty, only 7 km from the historic township of Clunes, close to Ballarat, Daylesford and the Central Goldfields, and within 90 minutes drive of the Melbourne CBD.
