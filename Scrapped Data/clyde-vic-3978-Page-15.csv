clyde-vic-3978,29 Cradle Avenue Clyde VIC 3978,"**UNDER OFFER / UNDER CONTRACT**
PASADENA ESTATE, CLYDE: **PLEASE NOTE THAT THE GARAGE ROLLER DOOR PANELS WILL BE REPLACED UPON SETTLEMENT** The suburb of Clyde is a flourishing neighbourhood with several new estates popping up in quick succession, but there is always the problem of having to wait lengthy periods for your land to title and for construction to commence.
So, why not purchase a near new home like this one in the beautiful Pasadena estate allowing you to literally move in and enjoy or rent out with ease?
Sitting high and mighty on an elevated block with a feature front rock retaining wall, the property's facade is very welcoming with its rendered accents, covered front portico and remote double garage.
Step inside and be greeted by display quality presentation that further adds to the overall appeal. The functional floorplan itself includes a North facing living and dining room with floating floors as well as a stylish kitchen complete with stone bench tops, all stainless steel appliances and a walk in pantry.
There is plenty of room for a young family too with 4 robed bedrooms, the master with a walk-in wardrobe and a full ensuite. Don't forget the family bathroom, second toilet and the bonus option of a 2nd sitting room that can also double up as a home office or children's play retreat.
Ducted heating and 2 split system air conditioners provide year round comfort, whilst outside the care free rear yard requires very little maintenance!
Within a short drive to freeway access and all amenities located in the townships of Berwick, Clyde and Cranbourne, this sensational opportunity is only minutes away from popular education facilities, such as the Clyde Primary School & Casey Grammar, Casey RACE Recreation/Aquatic Centre and Casey Indoor Sports Centre. With multiple shopping precincts available in Pasadena itself, Selandra Rise/Cascades on Clyde and The Hunt Club, local amenities are always going to be close by. The recently revamped Cranbourne Park Shopping Centre offers an abundance of cafes and restaurants and don't forget the proposed Cranbourne East train station, or the existing ones situated right throughout the South East!
If you want your family to have easy access to the very best in entertainment, education and recreation then call today before it's SELLING, SELLING ..... SOLD!
