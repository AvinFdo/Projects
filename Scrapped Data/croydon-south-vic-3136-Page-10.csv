This magnificent single level weatherboard home is perfectly positioned on a large flat block in a quiet yet convenient part of Croydon South and will provide complete family happiness for everyone.
The home has a family friendly floor plan that offers you 4 good sized bedrooms, the main at the rear of the home has a full ensuite and 4 built in robes.
There are 2 zoned living areas that will allow the family to spread out.

The centrally located kitchen is well equipped with plenty of bench, cupboard space and dishwasher to ensure the chef of the family makes their kitchen rule for any meal occasion.
Before we take in the outdoors we mustn't forget other internal features which include gas ducted heating, split system air conditioning, open fire place, modern updated bathroom with 2nd toilet, polished hardwood floors through out all walk and living area's, carpeted bedrooms for comfort, high ceilings plus freshly painted through, in soft modern colours and tones.
Moving out from the family room you'll discover the expansive undercover deck that will be ideal for family gatherings, parties, casual BBQ's, cool afternoon drinks or leisurely weekend breakfasts with a coffee and the paper all whilst being able to keep a close eye on the children and pets playing safely in the backyard.
Off road car accommodation is well taken care of in the secure carport that has room for 4 vehicles, whilst the long concrete drive will easily fit another 3 to 4 cars.
The 2 large storage sheds in the backyard will provide heaps of space for your gardening tools and all other items that need storing.
