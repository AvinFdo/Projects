This 3-bedroom 1-bathroom home doesnt pull any punches. Its solidly built and lovingly maintained in its original condition with some crafty additions made over the years. In fact, the 557-square metre block has been used to its full capacity!
A lockable carport has been added onto the garage, giving you undercover parking space for five vehicles. Or trailers. Or tools. Or trailers full of tools! Theres also an additional storage area attached to the end of the garage.
A massive deck provides an indoor-outdoor feel to the home, and thanks to the large block size the backyard has plenty of room for pets and kids.
Internally its ready to be lived in, with timber floors and features giving a warm ambiance that suits the open-plan living and dining areas. The three bedrooms are all carpeted, with a built-in-robe to the main, and air-conditioning unit and ducted heating mean comfort whatever the season.
