doncaster-vic-3108,4/490 Doncaster Road Doncaster VIC 3108,"Easy Living in the Heart of Doncaster
Its privacy ensured by a position set well back from the road and an easy flow outdoors to the sheltered charms of its substantial backyard, this stylishly presented, 3 bedroom + study townhouse is a relaxing sanctuary in a vibrant Doncaster setting. Directly opposite the Eastern Golf Club, metres from Westfield Doncaster and moments from the Park & Ride, the home is ideally positioned for all your urban lifestyle aspirations.
With attractive Bamboo flooring underfoot, plenty of glorious natural light and appealing garden vistas in all directions, the home is particularly up-lifting as it highlights a broad open-plan living space that is arranged around a central staircase. The kitchen is suited to family life with volumes of cabinetry, whilst the flow outdoors to a generous backyard and paved outdoor dining suggests an al fresco lifestyle awaits.
The bedrooms are all set upstairs, privately, away from living. Parents will love the privacy of a master suite with its own study, an ensuite and walk-in robes, whilst the remaining bedrooms are adjacent to a central bathroom with separate wc and there is also a powder room downstairs.
Central gas ducted heating is a benefit of this home with split system cooling in each room and a large double garage.
Just wander over to Westfield for all your shopping needs, cafes, cinemas and plenty of buses, whilst you have plenty of parkland nearby, the Golf Club across the road and the Park & Ride just metres away for incredibly easy city commuting.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"3
