drysdale-vic-3222,192-200 Whitcombes Road Drysdale VIC 3222,"Lifestyle Property with Views to Corio Bay
Commanding views of Corio Bay and evening sunsets dominate this idyllic property perched high on the slopes of Murradoc Hill overlooking the Drysdale countryside. Established trees give privacy and attract local birdlife whilst you absorb the peace and quiet.
Situated on approx 7.7 acres and known locally as the Black Hills. The black clay soil produces some of the best wine on the Bellarine. This majestic European-flavoured home was built to last with solid brick features and cedar timber panelling throughout. On entry the imposing living room has towering ceilings and open fireplace. The home flows seamlessly through a formal dining area, kitchen and family area all facing to the north-west providing natural light and warmth. Two minor downstairs bedrooms are serviced by a family bathroom and rumpus area or sitting room. Leading upstairs to the master suite is a study or fourth bedroom. The open loft-like retreat sits adjacent to the master bedroom and ensuite which incorporates its own balcony with spectacular views.
Outdoors is a blank canvas with potential plus for rolling gardens, a new vineyard or several paddocks for livestock. An over-sized double garage is attached to the main dwelling and a small outbuilding used as an observatory for star-gazing has power connected and manual opening roof. Town water is connected via a private line to the property with tank water available.
Inspection is a must for potential purchasers looking for that sea or tree change with the convenience of good schools, local amenities and leisure activities nearby. Contact the agent to arrange your appointment
to inspect this beautiful property on the outskirts of Drysdale.
