Here is a great opportunity to restore an historically significant property with two street frontages and a right of way to the rear, close to transport and freeway access and ten minutes away from the CBD. Its intriguing exterior detail includes arched windows surmounted by decoration of steers heads, suggesting that the building may originally have been a butchers shop and dwelling. The property, with Baltic pine floors, an open fireplace and interior plaster ornament, offers several large rooms (potentially three bedrooms) and a spacious bluestone courtyard, with a garage entered from Perry Street.","SOLD - $806,000","3
