Within walking distance to the eclectic eateries and specialty shops of Smith & Brunswick Streets the home is extremely comfortable having been updated and extended some 20 years ago but still offers plenty of scope for further improvement.
Offering a flexible floor plan of 2 bedrooms, 2 living areas, basic but functional kitchen with electric upright stove, bathroom with laundry facilities and a pleasant easterly facing courtyard with right of way access at the rear.
Ideal for the devoted inner city dweller on a budget, first home buyer looking to buy within close proximity of the CBD or the astute investor wanting a strong return and assured future capital growth...","SOLD - $557,500","2

Here is a great opportunity to restore an historically significant property with two street frontages and a right of way to the rear, close to transport and freeway access and ten minutes away from the CBD. Its intriguing exterior detail includes arched windows surmounted by decoration of steers heads, suggesting that the building may originally have been a butchers shop and dwelling. The property, with Baltic pine floors, an open fireplace and interior plaster ornament, offers several large rooms (potentially three bedrooms) and a spacious bluestone courtyard, with a garage entered from Perry Street.","SOLD - $806,000","3
