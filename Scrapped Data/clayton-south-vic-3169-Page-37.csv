clayton-south-vic-3169,35 Manoon Road Clayton South VIC 3169,"A CLASSIC HOME ON AROUND 1,008SQM WITH DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL (STCA)
Even with a quick inspection of this classic home you can clearly see it has been beautifully maintained throughout its life and its condition is testament to its caring long term owners. Resting on a flat block measuring around 1,008sqm, the home is a prime candidate for further development where you could keep the home and build behind, or simply start from scratch and design a stylish modern unit development (all options are STCA). Behind its pale painted facade you find a warm and inviting home featuring a generous lounge room with gas heater and a split system air conditioner plus a meals area integrated in to the pristine kitchen and a separate study or work area. There are 3 robed bedrooms and a family bathroom that is complemented by a laundry with additional shower facilities and a separate toilet. Outside, you find a large covered patio for entertaining and a massive yard with great potential for tradesmen and hobbyists with the massive 4 car garage plus workshop a great bonus. It's even well positioned with schools and central Clayton's shops, cafes, buses and trains all nearby.","SOLD - $910,000","3

clayton-south-vic-3169,8 Second Street CLAYTON SOUTH VIC 3169,"There Are Great Opportunities Here!
Consider the possibilities - this property is primed for redevelopment (subject to council approvals) and with a location like this it presents a splendid opportunity. There's easy access to Monash Medical Centre, Monash University, and major roads, and it is only a short drive to large shopping centres such as the Ikea Home Maker Centre in Springvale. Trains, parks, local shops, and recreation are all within walking distance, and buses virtually stop at the front door. Land size is approximately 628.5sq m - perfectly suited to a dream home or perhaps a development. The 3-bedroom weatherboard home, presently occupying the site, has seen faithful service but it is probably nearing retirement age.

Attention home buyers, developers and investors!
This one owner family home located ‘on the boarder’ with Clayton boasts all the classic charm of yesteryear. A great opportunity currently exists for the home to be retained and a second dwelling constructed to the rear (STCA).
The home features a large entrance hall, generous formal living room (or fourth bedroom), chef-friendly kitchen with meals zone, traditional family bathroom, three spacious bedrooms, family room, separate laundry, secure garage and carport. (NOTE: Floor plan available upon request).
Additional features include gas heating, air conditioning, timber flooring (under carpets), wide driveway, superb rear garden and more.
FOR THE DEVELOPERS: A wide driveway measuring approximately 3.5m and generous rear yard measuring approximately 18m (depth) X 15.50m (width) should allow for a second dwelling to be constructed at the rear (STCA). Removing the existing family room extension will allow even more room for a larger second dwelling (STCA). Rear yard is orientated towards the north.
This exceptional property is located within reach of Clayton Village, Clayton Train Station, Monash Hospital, Monash University, Clayton Aquatic Centre, various bus routes, golf courses, parks and more.
