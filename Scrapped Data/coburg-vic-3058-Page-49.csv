coburg-vic-3058,28 Webb Street Coburg VIC 3058,"Classic Californian In A Premium Pocket
Classical Californian beauty enhanced by traditional features including leadlight windows, Baltic pine flooring, fireplace, bay window and ornate cornice a-top high ceilings, blends with a perfect position to introduce a lifestyle of excellence in this immediately appealing home.
Nestled in a coveted tree-lined pocket, it enjoys a premium position just a short walk from the bus, station, local shops, tram and the home-maker centre. Spacious open plan living pushes out from a stainless steel equipped contemporary kitchen and seamlessly spills through French doors onto a decked and paved undercover zone in a generous rear yard ready for private, low-upkeep alfresco enjoyment.
The three bedrooms (main with fireplace) are well served by a modern bathroom and a second toilet adjacent to the large laundry.
Throw in ducted heating and a split system unit, off street parking, established gardens and a 366m2 allotment (approx) that offers space to extend if desired (stca) and it's a winner on Webb.
