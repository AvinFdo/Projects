Flaunting a tranquil splendour, this secluded family retreat, set upon an elevated garden allotment of 858sqm (approx.) on the cusp of the prestigious 'Tintern' estate is undoubtedly a remarkable find designed with family pleasure in mind.
The inviting residence continues to impress throughout the fastidiously presented interiors ideally set out over three split-levels and affording a flexible functionality. Comprising an elegant formal lounge with plush quality carpet adding a luxury feel, and an adjoining, enclosed sunroom provides a most peaceful escape to enjoy the views with your morning cuppa.
A spacious formal dining, with bespoke 'buffet', could easily be utilised as a fourth bedroom or further living space, and the modern kitchen, well appointed with a breakfast bar, double pantry and De Longhi dishwasher, extends into the meals area and family zone.
This central family hub accesses both the sideway and covered patio abounded by lush greenery creating a tranquil feel, while the rear gardens are a delightful discovery with brick paved pathways meandering between grassy areas for children to play, and dotted with 'secret' sitting spots for serene relaxation.
Head downstairs via the sunroom to a fabulous rumpus boasting a wood-fire heater and access to an under-home storeroom and a fitted workshop, plus sliding door access out to the carport.
The elevated master bedroom is complemented with abundant robing, air-conditioned comfort and a full ensuite; positioned well away from the further two double bedrooms fitted with full height robing and sharing the newly refreshed family bathroom with a separate shower and bathtub, plus separate toilet.
Notable benefits also include gas ducted heating, air-conditioning, ceiling fans, high ceilings with ornate roses, a separate laundry with pet door and double troughs plus plentiful driveway parking and a double carport.

croydon-south-vic-3136,8 Gardenia Street Croydon South VIC 3136,"Sophisticated and Modern Suburban Living
Occupying a fantastic corner block in a family friendly neighbourhood, this extensively renovated cottage style home is exceptionally pleasing to the eye.
Sleek, modern and brought well into the 21st century, this beautifully brick rendered residence looks more like it should be on the cover of a magazine than in its superb suburban location.
A Fully landscaped front garden and clever crossover driveway as you enter the property sets the tone for what is an all-round impeccably presented dwelling on 516sqm (approx).
Polished floorboards throughout give this home an open and relaxed feel as you enter into the welcoming living and dining space. Featuring a gas log heater, wall tv inset and plenty of light from the north facing windows this is a spectacular space to spend some time.
Connecting seamlessly with the living and dining area is the updated kitchen, featuring a floating bench, glass splashback, stainless steel gas cook top, oven, dishwasher and rangehood. Brilliantly placed, a servery window and glass doors to the outside deck make indoor/outdoor living a breeze.
Outside the magnificent deck and undercover alfresco, including completely covered two tiered sittings areas, connection for a wall mounted tv and to the kitchen servery, entertaining here will be a pleasure.
Back inside, three good-sized bedrooms - two with ceiling fans, built-in robes, provide plenty of accommodation options. Sleek materials enhance the clean, contemporary lines of the master bathroom which includes a separate shower and bath and fashionable light fittings.
This home is packed full of extras including new window furnishings, evaporative cooling, gas ducted heating, LED lighting, sensor lights in the hallway, toilet and pantry, alarm system, security cameras, modern light fittings, upgraded switchboard, power supply for an outdoor spa, internet and foxtel connectivity.
Perhaps most importantly, the home is also connected to mains fed 2.2KW solar power with which its new owners will be able to take advantage of the current government tariff of a minimum 6.2 cents per kilowatt hour for excess electricity fed back into the grid - an added bonus when it comes to paying the power bill.
Renovated to great effect and presented in the modern-day, this charming package really has it all. In a location close to Ringwood East and Croydon shopping, the re-developing Eastland Shopping Precinct, local transport and restaurants and within walking distance to arguably the area's best education facilities in Tintern and Tinternvale this property is sure to attract wide appeal.
- Fully renovated cottage style home
- Fantastic covered alfresco entertaining area
- Central kitchen with floating bench and servery
- Modern bathroom with classic finishes
- Landscaped garden with dual crossover driveway
- Easy access to Tintern and local shopping
