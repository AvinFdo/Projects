clyde-north-vic-3978,106 Newgrange Boulevard Clyde North VIC 3978,"FightMND - SOLD $700,000!
Henley and Brown Property Group have joined FightMND's army to help fight Motor Neurone Disease (MND).
MND is a rare neurological condition that progressively damages the motor neurones or 'nerves' in the brain and spinal cord causing the associated muscles to waste away.
The symptoms vary from person to person and, heartbreakingly, as there is no remission or known cure, death is usually seen within 2-5 years of being diagnosed.
Henley and Brown Property Group, along with dozens of local trades and suppliers have built and donated this home to be auctioned by Harcourts for FighMND to help raise much needed funding for the FightMND movement.
106 Newgrange Boulevard Clyde North:
The home is Henley's best-selling Emperor 38. A top-of-the-line home, there is nothing you will go without both functionally and aesthetically. The 38 square home featuring four bedrooms, including a hotel style master suite and three secondary bedrooms upstairs all with walk-in-wardrobes.
The living, family, kitchen and alfresco zones integrate so seamlessly together that the alfresco becomes an extension of your living space. There's also a leisure area upstairs
