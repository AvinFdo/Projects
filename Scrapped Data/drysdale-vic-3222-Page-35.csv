drysdale-vic-3222,14 Delungra Avenue DRYSDALE VIC 3222,"Family Fantastic!
In a suburb that is renowned for being family friendly (offering a wide range of opportunities for adults and children alike), it is not just the township that speaks to the needs and desires of the Smith's, Jones's and perhaps not-so-average clan...this home answers a number of questions about not only the basics, but also the lifestyle that goes hand in hand with a coastal residency.
Just a few years young, you have the benefit here of being able to purchase a near new home with all of the modern comforts you would aspire to, with the added bonus of the outdoor infrastructure being completed and ready to enjoy. Situated on a gently sloping 723 sqm allotment, the entertaining and dedicated play areas are separated by an inviting expanse of lawn and central garden beds, ultimately ensuring that family members and guests of all ages have the space to relax and unwind.
The home itself is arranged over three levels to gain the best possible use of the both floor area and the surrounding land. Entry to the home is achieved by either the contemporary front door, or the secure internal access from the double garage, both of which lead into the passage that provides a space saving European laundry and handy powder room that also services the study / fourth bedroom on this level. The master bedroom is also located on this level away from the bustle of the upper level living and lower level children's retreat. Boasting a modern ensuite and WIR, your privacy is most definitely assured.
Stunning polished timber floors grace the living space and provide the perfect complement to the open, yet cleverly zoned lounge and dining areas separated by a top quality and beautifully appointed kitchen with designer lighting and glass splash-backs above the 900mm stainless steel cooker. A dishwasher and sink in the l-shaped island allow for an abundance of work surface and breakfast bar whilst the walk in pantry is perfect for storage of food and smaller appliances. Overlooking the charming rural landscape and decked alfresco, this is sure to be the true heart of the home.
Downstairs, children have two large bedrooms to sleep in with their own bathroom, separate WC and rumpus room with direct access to a further entertaining area and the garden. Talk about spoilt! Teenagers, in particular, will relish the freedom and seclusion they can achieve in this area.
Finished in the all-important neutral tones with sought after features such as square stopped ceilings, split system air conditioning, ducted heating and downlights, this is a delightful example of current trends that will not date for many, many years to come. A combination of well positioned highlight and conventional windows flood the home with natural light, minimising energy bills and making the home a pleasant refuge from the daily work routine.
Within a short drive of all amenities in the busy Drysdale town centre, excellent options for schooling and all of the fun of the nearby beaches and sporting facilities, this home is also a short 15 minutes from Geelong and therefore the ideal haven for YOUR family.
- Close to all amenities.
- Coastal location 15 minutes from Geelong
- Near new 3/4 bedroom home
- Beautifully presented/nothing to do
