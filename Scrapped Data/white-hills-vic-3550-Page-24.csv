white-hills-vic-3550,11 Waratah Street WHITE HILLS VIC 3550,"Renovated 4 Bedroom Beauty!
The young couple who own this home have lovingly renovated it. Now all the work has been done some lucky buyer will be able to move in and enjoy the results. The house has been repainted inside and out, new wiring, new kitchen and bathroom. The rich burgundy carpet throughout the house adds that extra touch of comfort and luxury. The location is the other attractive aspect of this house. Just a block away from Weeroona College, the walking track along the creek and close to the swimming pool, this is an incredibly handy position. The family cook will also be delighted by the convenience of the new kitchen. With its high quality, wooden cabinetry, brand new Westinghouse oven, stove top and double, stainless steel sink, cooking will be a pleasure. The kitchen also opens onto the living room which has an overhead fan, air conditioning and a cosy gas heater for the coming winter months. The high ceilings, the storage space in the laundry and quality curtains throughout are other features which make this house special. The well cared for garden has a great lawn at the back for the kids and built up garden beds. And Dad (or Mum) will love the large shed, which is not only powered and has a concrete floor but also boasts benches, shelves and a pot belly stove. You may want to move in yourself or rent this one. The house is not far from the hospital and given the influx of workers who will be building the new hospital this house could make a fantastic, low-maintenance rental property or perfect investment.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"4
