clunes-vic-3370,28 Fraser Street CLUNES VIC 3370,"Old State Savings Bank in Enviable Condition!
This incredible example of early goldfields architecture was built in the 1860's and still displays many of the original period features.
Featured in the 2003 movie starring Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom, the Old State Bank was the pinnacle of the Bank Robbery scene, with the original Bank vault and counter on display. Both of these amazing historical features are yours to own today!
The building has been thoughtfully restored in keeping with the period, and on display in the upstairs formal lounge are the framed window signs, which were found in storage and also lovingly restored.
This incredible building has an entrance into the shop area as well as one into the residence, where you are greeted by stunning warm baltic floorboards which flow through the lower level - there you will also find the cosy country kitchen complete with original soul warming combustion stove; downstairs bedroom (currently used as additional shop space) and ornate staircase with cedar balustrade. In front of the staircase you will at once notice the tiny Alice in Wonderland door set high into the wall, which was once used to store sensitive bank documents away from prying eyes. You will find open fire places in the shop, office and bedroom
The stairs and upper two levels have been recently re-carpeted. Level 2 displays a bedroom, study and bathroom, while the upper level offers 3 bedrooms one with gas heater and another with air conditioning, walk in linen closet and the grand formal living and dining area.
A cellar is also attached to the kitchen downstairs, which is currently accessed externally, though once upon a time there was a door from the kitchen, although this has been bricked up at some stage. The original door from the kitchen is included and someone may want to restore this access point to it's original setting in the future!
The State Savings Bank was built during an era of grandeur fit for the prestigious position afforded a bank manager, and the older members of the community remember invitations to the grand balls held upstairs in the formal living area (then known as the ball room) being the most sought after in town!
Clunes itself is well known for it's Book Town weekend whereby thousands of visitors converge on the tiny town, as well as having been the backdrop for not only the 2003 Ned Kelly movie, but also Mad Max and Halifax FP. Included are photographs of Heath Ledger exiting the bank during filming of the Ned Kelly Movie and also a wonderful shot of the Clunes Main Street with the Bank in the background as it was during the movie set!
Book your inspection today to view this fascinating piece of Victorian Goldfields history!
