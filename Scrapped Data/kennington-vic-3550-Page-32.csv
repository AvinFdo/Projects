kennington-vic-3550,1/13 Roslyn Court KENNINGTON VIC 3550,"Kennington Class by the Water
BUILT and finished to a very high standard, this contemporary architect-designed Glenn Loddon family home has idyllic water views, a light, airy and open, split-level layout and so many extras you'll think it's Christmas all year round. The home's north-easterly aspect takes full advantage of the sun. An attractive low-maintenance garden surrounds the home with a dry riverbed a highlight. Polished Tasmanian oak floorboards and stairs add warmth and light to the interior. Subtle Duets' blinds fitted by Needlecraft let the daylight in and give the windows a clean, uncluttered look. Heating and cooling is zoned and via three refrigerated systems. Fitted with stainless steel smeg appliances, great storage, (built-in pantry, easy-glide drawers and much more), the kitchen is a dream. The island bench is finished with a granite overlay, has a breakfast bar, and water views. A meals area is adjacent and overlooks a large family room on the next level. Sliding doors open to a fabulous decked entertaining area, again with water views, and featuring a stylish leaf wall sculpture. Timber stairs lead to the main bedroom with its walk-in wardrobe, three-piece en suite and front row' balcony views. The owner has taken photos of the sunrise across Kennington Reservoir from his bed. At the far end of the home two more bedrooms, both with mirrored built-in wardrobes share a very large three-piece bathroom with spa bath. Ample laundry storage includes an in-built ironing board. The double garage has shelving, auto roller door plus the benefit of enough space at the entrance for a third vehicle. Other features include tinted windows, a ducted vacuum system, Crimsafe-style security doors, insulation, a gas assisted solar panel hot-water service and two rainwater tanks. Surround sound enhances television viewing and is wired to the deck and lounge room. Schools, shops, the uni, sportsfields and tennis courts are only minutes away. The extras are too numerous to mention so call the agent. He'll show you everything and prepare to be impressed.","SOLD - $615,000","3

kennington-vic-3550,6 Roslyn Court KENNINGTON VIC 3550,"Architectural Elegance
Water views, birdsong, top schools, excellent walking tracks and one of the best addresses in Bendigo; it doesn't get much better than this.
Then add perfect outdoor retreats, spa and pool, and a bespoke Russell Parsons home, and you have one of the most beautiful homes or a wonderful investment, all tied up in the prettiest of bows.
The gloss of parquetry floors greets you in the foyer, setting the scene for what's to come a contemporary home with four bedrooms, three living areas, two workshops, and a study.
The first floor hosts the master bedroom, formal sitting room and superb en suite.
The furnishings and fittings are first class, and of course there is ducted heating and cooling, ceiling fans and much more.
Take the short flight of stairs to the main floor and here is the hub of the home, the living areas open one into another, giving a feeling of light and space.
The blonde-wood kitchen has a built-in pantry, gas cooktop, dishwasher, and roller drawers. It overlooks the back garden and the barbecue area, so you can keep an eye on the kids as they play. The dining room is adjacent, and that too opens into a large family room or lounge.
Set on over 1000 square metres, there's so much to see at this property, you'll need to set aside a good amount of time, phone the agent and inspect it at a leisurely pace.
You can't help but be impressed with all there is on offer.","SOLD - $650,000","4
