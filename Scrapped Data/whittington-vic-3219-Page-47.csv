whittington-vic-3219,43 St Albans Road East Geelong VIC 3219,"Renovators Dream
This house has been the centre for generations of the same family over 4 decades. It was last sold and purchased in 1974 by a young man as a surprise for his new wife after the arrival of their first child - and became the cornerstone of the family they built together in the years since, right up to now. The original almost 100 year old home has been renovated and extended twice during the 80s to extend the kitchen and add a large laundry accommodating a growing family - but it has retained much of the character of the original weatherboard cottage home. The 12 foot ceilings and high roofline provide spaciousness to the interior which only needs someone with an eye for possibility to come in and create something wonderful from this well-loved family home. Whilst it's not restricted by Heritage Overlay, the surrounding area is known for the retention of original character homes during renovation - and this home is the last in the block to need a renovator's touch to bring it back to life and recreate the charm of the original features as well as attending to the quirks and wrinkles that age bring. The home is located in a very family oriented area with a number of schools close by, a short walk to local shops and cafes, and the neighbourhood feeling abounds in the area. Revive and restore this charming old home and create your own family history here.
