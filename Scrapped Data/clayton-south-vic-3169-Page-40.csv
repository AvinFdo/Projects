clayton-south-vic-3169,4 Bronwyn Court CLAYTON SOUTH VIC 3169,"BIG Block = BIG Opportunity!
If you've been looking for a property that has potential to subdivide, or perhaps just need the extra space...this could be for you! Special features include; 3 spacious bedrooms, main bathroom, a country-style updated kitchen and a separate lounge. There's ducted heating throughout, evaporative cooling and gas appliances.
The large block has potential to subdivide (S.T.C.A) or would be ideal for the kids and pets to roam and there is a pergola, perfect for outdoor entertaining in the warmer months. At the rear of the property there is a recently developed childrens playground on Council land and car accommodation is supplied by a large double steel garage with plenty of “off-street” parking.
It's hard to find a block this size in a quiet court location...be quick!
