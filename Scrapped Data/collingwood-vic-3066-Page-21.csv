collingwood-vic-3066,5/394 Wellington Street Collingwood VIC 3066,"Refurbished 2 Bedroom Plus Courtyard Plus Garage
Itâs rare we can offer a first floor spacious and light filled refurbished two bedroom apartment with two big pluses â an L-shaped courtyard under licence from the O.C. and a lock up garage.
So whilst the apartment is incredibly attractive with its entry hall, modernised kitchen with meals area, two genuine double bedrooms with robes, an expansive lounge with a neutral dÃ©cor, new carpets and a northerly aspect, those two pluses make this a must see for an owner occupier or astute investor.
Positioned at the rear of the block, away from any traffic noise yet within the hub of inner city life, a stroll to the delights of Smith and Johnston Streets, corner pubs and cafes and Yarra trail. Make time to have a look, you wonât regret the decision.","SOLD - $545,000","2

collingwood-vic-3066,208/18-22 Peel St Collingwood VIC 3066,"7 Star Sustainability 1 bedroom Apartment in Oxford & Peel
It is with much regret that we offer for sale our beautiful East-facing apartment on the second floor of the almost-new Oxford & Peel apartment building (just 50 apartments in the building).
Designed by Small Giants & Jackson Clements Burrows, this apartment building was built with sustainability at its core. The building is a socially progressive urban residential precinct with a 7 star sustainability rating and is only one year old. Superb location, in inner-city Collingwood, just one block from Smith St with it's cafes and restaurants and 2 blocks from Victoria St. Fantastic public transport options on both of these major corridors.
East facing apartment is a spacious 51sqm on the inside with a 5sqm balcony, with an industrial style. The apartment has: one bedroom, one bathroom, small desk area, dining area, combined living/kitchen, an outdoor balcony, laundry, 1 carpark, bike spaces and an extra lockable storage cupboard. The apartment building is fully secured, with caged parking spaces, security doors and intercom.
It has Engineered oak floorboards throughout with polished concrete in the bedroom and a tiled area outside. The high ceilings, and large glass panels make the apartment feel even more spacious and bright. The wooden/ply kitchen, has ample storage space, almost brand new kitchen (Miele oven and gas cooktop) and water filter (all just one year old).
A new smaller building has just being completed directly adjacent to the apartment. Honestly, it has blocked some view, but to our surprise it has blocked none of the light that fills the apartment, has provided wonderful privacy we didn't have before and we now know that no taller building is allowed to be built nearby so the present private but light-filled experience is ensured.
There is also a communal rooftop which you have full use of, that has a BBQ, tables, and incredible panoramic views of the city and all the way to the mountains over Abbotsford. There is wifi already connected throughout the whole building. It has a lift and downstairs in the building is a great cafÃ©!
The apartment has no air conditioning but it has a 7 star thermal rating, is double glazed, cross ventilated and has ceiling fans for summer cooling and excellent hydronic heating for winter. All function fantastically.
This apartment is great as a home or investment. It currently rents out at an 80% occupancy rate through Airbnb, easily earning enough income to cover all mortgage/rates/bills plus extra to spare. Regretful sale but we need the equity for other ventures.
Looking for a quick sale with settlement at the end of September/beginning of October. Price is firm and fair, contract of sale is ready and we are ready to sell to the first person to accept our offer of sale. Let's show that an apartment can still be sold in an honest way, without all the real estate games.
Please phone us to organise an inspection or to receive a copy of the contract of sale.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"1
