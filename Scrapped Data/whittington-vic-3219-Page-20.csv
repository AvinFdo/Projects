whittington-vic-3219,4/4 Koala Court WHITTINGTON VIC 3219,"Best Presented T/House On The Fringe Of St. Albans Park
The heading says it all. Situated in a fantastic little pocket, this is an opportunity not to be missed. Predicted not to be on the market very long & would be ideal for 1st home buyers, investors, or those looking to downsize. This 2BR Townhouse is beautifully presented throughout & appears to be as fresh as the day it was built, which is real credit to the current owner. Upon entering the front door, the property automatically gives you a fantastic impression and that very warm homely feel. Features; 2 double sized BR's, both with BIR's, large lounge, which is complimented by double sliding doors. The fully appointed kitchen offers plenty of bench & cupboard space& the adjoining meals area provides plenty of natural light. Separate bathroom and laundry, also with bench & cupboard space complete the internal rooms of the home. Once outdoors, a very private & secure Nth. facing courtyard awaits, which will certainly get plenty of use now that Summer is fast approaching & overlooks the very neat & tidy garden. There is also a separate area which is secured by a gate, making it great for those who have pets. Car accommodation is taken care of with a remote control SLUG. Additional features include; D/Heating + Split System & 9' Ceilings. Close to all facilities, amenities, shopping centers, schools, sporting grounds& public transport.
