clifton-hill-vic-3068,57 Alexander Street Clifton Hill VIC 3068,"Auction This Saturday At 1.30pm, View From 1.10pm
3 Bedroom Period Family Home on 282m2
This absolute charmer will give a family the opportunity of buying into the area on a more modest price range than most double fronted homes. Let’s cover two aspects first – it was never part of the tunnel project and a new development is proposed across the street. Ask for a copy of the projections.
Immediately livable with high decorative ceilings, open fire places, polished boards and a fresh neutral décor allows immediate occupation with 3-4 bedrooms, lounge, modern kitchen with meals and bathroom with euro laundry.
Potential abounds with its large rear garden which can accommodate further extensions or plan to go up if more room is needed. Make the effort to visit as you’ll be pleased by your discoveries.","SOLD - $1,385,000","3
