cockatoo-vic-3781,129 Woori Yallock Road Cockatoo VIC 3781,"Historic Weatherboard
I am so proud to present this character weatherboard to the market. There are so many character elements that make this the picture perfect dream home. Picket fences, an arch of roses at the front gate, privet hedges, the contrast of red brick & weatherboard. A sympathetic ""Scandi"" renovation and master-suite extension takes it to a whole other level of “YES!” There is even a separate 4th bedroom with own veranda, ensuite and robe which would work for guests, a teen or even as an AirB&B. All on a clear sunny 1422m2 block with a 11m x 8.7m American Barn style shed with 3-Phase Power.
Inside, the colour palette makes for a warm and homely atmosphere with the natural stained timber floors & country-style kitchen adding to the period charm. A particular feature is the working Metters cast iron wood stove set centre stage in the kitchen.
The afternoon sunlight streams through the large windows at the rear into the main kitchen, dining & family lounge area. Retreat to the living for some quiet time before you drift off to heaven/bed in the recently completed master with wood panelled gabled ceiling and exposed beams.
Outside, the fully fenced rear garden is the perfect spot to unwind - a patio area for entertaining, edible forest (veggie garden), lawn & chook pen.

cockatoo-vic-3781,25 Mountain Road Cockatoo VIC 3781,"Reserve Your Hill's Habitat
It’s a Muddy! Highly sought after mud brick homes enjoy a bit of a cult status. As well as the obvious aesthetic appeal their thermal mass keeps them cool in summer, toasty in the winter months.
Positioned on THE BEST ROAD IN COCKATOO (guess where I live?!) 25 Mountain Road boasts a meandering lit driveway past one of the two fenced paddocks. The first thing some will notice is the big shed with front carport. You’ll fit the boat in no worries. Others will be keen to look inside the house.
A simple home with 2 bedrooms and large laundry and bathroom. This could be all you need but extending would be straight-forward (STCA) either now or down the track.
Speaking of tracks. There is one directly into Mountain Road reserve. Suddenly the 5110m2 block becomes so much more. There are no neighbours to the west - only gums, ferns, a creek and native wildlife. Bliss.
A second fenced paddock down the back with a shelter.
