croydon-vic-3136,289 Dorset Road Croydon VIC 3136,"Luxury urban living in Croydon Central.
Peacefully concealed behind a private fence, this newly constructed brick-veneer home is imbued with unhindered style and sophistication, poised on a meticulously landscaped block within an ultra-convenient Croydon Central location.
Designed to immerse the occupants in luxurious and spacious living, this stunning split-level residence displays the latest quality appointments and finishes, underpinned by a merging of neutral tones, black accents and solid wormy chestnut timber floors that radiate warmth and homeliness. Furthermore, the adoption of clean contemporary lines throughout develops an impression of class and distinction - one of many appreciable benefits that sets this home apart from the norm.
With a highest priority given to ensure the home excels in relaxation and entertaining, the masterfully conceived layout affords the occupants two spacious living areas. The formal lounge achieves the feeling of comfort and liveability while the open-plan family/meals offers a dynamic, welcoming domain for family and friends with ten-foot ceilings creating a sense of space and volume. From here, the room extends outdoors to a Merbau entertaining deck overlooking the fully landscaped backyard featuring a perfectly manicured Kings Pride Buffalo lawn and an established tree providing shade.
Sleek and sublime, every inch of the state-of-the-art kitchen has been well considered, showcasing premium Smeg appliances including a 900mm stainless steel electric oven and gas stove, in addition to an integrated dishwasher. With an obvious approach to ensuring streamlined practicality is paired with luxury, other highlights include; stone benchtops, marble-look stone backsplash, black tapware, pendant lighting, soft-close drawers and cupboards as well as stunning 2pac cabinetry. Lastly, tucked behind the kitchen is a semi butler's pantry offering a vast amount of storage, including a wine rack in addition to stone benchtops.
The master bedroom is generously sized and offers soul-soothing rejuvenation, beginning with a fitted walk-in robe leading into a full ensuite showcasing a frameless rain shower with double shower head, twin stone vanity, black square profile tapware, in-wall cistern, large mirror and large format floor-to-wall tiles. Three additional bedrooms are well proportioned, feature double built-in robes and share a bathroom echoing the same unrivalled modish beauty as the ensuite and incorporating a luxe walk-in rain shower, freestanding deep-soak bath, stylish stone vanity and separate toilet.
Boasting a six-star energy rating, the home immerses the occupants in a range of carefully curated inclusions, with highlights listing as; study, large tiled laundry with cupboard and bench space, Daikin inverter ducted reverse cycle air-conditioning (zoned), LED lights, double glazed windows in living areas, square set plastering, walk-in storage cupboard, double linen cupboard, solid timber stairs, quality plush carpet, privacy blinds, Colourbond roof, two water tanks totalling 5000 litres (connected to bathrooms), underfloor insulation, shed and remote-entry double garage with timber-look sectional tilt roller door as well as internal and rear access.
This property is set in an ultra-convenient location within walking distance to Croydon Central, Croydon Railway Station, Croydon Park with barbeque area and playground, Croydon Memorial Pool, bus stop, Hewish Road Child Care Centre, Ruskin Park and Croydon Primary Schools, Swinburne TAFE, as well as being just a brief drive from The Good Shepherd Primary School and EastLink freeway.

This much loved classic three bedroom home has been held in the same family for many years. It's time for a new family to unlock the potential in this immaculately presented and maintained home. Situated in a leafy pocket, on a manicured 720m2 (approx.) corner block, just eighteen minutes' walk to Croydon station and a little more to the shops, café, restaurants and cinema of main street. Not to mention schools including Croydon Primary just down the road and Luther College just a short car trip away, Croydon park, Croydon outdoor pool, Aquahub and the library. The very neat established garden and brick veneer home with terracotta roof tiles gives a welcoming first impression. Ahead of its time the spacious design, in original condition, features two living areas, traditional formal lounge room and separate dining room with plenty of room to entertain the whole family on Christmas day and a casual open plan sitting room and meals area adjacent to the practical, centrally located timber kitchen with a large pantry. Three good size bedrooms, two with built in robes, are serviced by a neat family bathroom and separate toilet plus laundry. Split system, ceiling fans and gas heater in the lounge room ensure comfort year round. The big back garden offers plenty of room for pets and kids to play plus there's a large double lock up garage with room for a workbench and plenty of off-street parking.

croydon-vic-3136,1/7 Victory Street Croydon VIC 3136,"A CLASS ABOVE
Wow, the original builder has transformed this neat three-bedroom two bathroom home into a modern home with all the bells and whistles. Highlighting new carpet to all the bedrooms and formal living area, and engaging engineering flooring that makes its own statement throughout much of the rest of the home. All windows have been dressed in quality blinds too.
Modernized bathrooms, laundry and the kitchen which flaunts Caesarstone stone bench tops and quality Westinghouse appliances have all been upgraded leaving little to do but to absorb these beautiful finishes in a home that is ideally designed to suit first home buyers right through to retirees and downsizers.
Not skimping on anything outside either, the gardens have been landscaped with new instant lawn features front and back, and with the addition of a Merbau deck to the side of the home, greater living and dining options are available during the warmer months.
Enhanced with evaporative cooling, ducted heating and a double garage with a rear roller door to access the back yard, the quiet location is extremely close to Croydon Main street shops and facilities, whilst benefiting from being a short commute to either Chirnside Park or Ringwood. Excellent schooling options are a few minutes up Maroondah Hwy and into the Croydon Hills vicinity, including Luther College, Yarra Valley Grammar and Good Shepherd Primary School.","SOLD - $695,000","3
