clifton-hill-vic-3068,83 Spensley Street CLIFTON HILL VIC 3068,"Ready to renovate, the perfect project
Under instructions from State Trustees. Rich in original features, poised to benefit from a total renovation, this classical brick Victorian will welcome the addition of contemporary elements inside and out. Current day spaces, introduced by a traditional arched entrance hall include three double bedrooms beneath high period ceilings. A central living room featuring an ornate ceiling rose and a period open fire place precedes a separate dining area accompanied by a basic kitchen zone before an external bathroom and laundry space demonstrate this home's readiness for renovation. Beyond, a courtyard with pedestrian right-of-way concludes a property that can be summed up in one word - potential. Proximity to village shops and cafes, Clifton Hill station and Quarries Park provide further impetus for giving this inner city original the modern makeover it deserves.

Close to Yarra Parklands, Spensley Street Primary, transport and Village cafes, this delightful residence has had only two owners since 1910. Recent renovations include restumping, rewiring and new plaster. Offering comfortable living now, this substantial property offers exciting potential for a future extension (STCA) to maximise the potential of the deep 6m wide northerly block. Entry from the bullnose verandah is to a high-ceilinged hallway, from which open two double bedrooms, one with built-in wardrobes. In the centre of the house is a spacious living room, leading to a large kitchen and meals zone, equipped with a Blanco range in the original fireplace, timber benchtops and ample storage. Beside a storage area to the rear is a large bathroom with laundry facilities and a separate WC. The deep paved courtyard has right of way access. This light-filled property in one of Clifton Hill’s most desirable locations features japanned floors, quality carpets and gas heating.
