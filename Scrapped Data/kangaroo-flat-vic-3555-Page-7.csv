kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,5 MITCHELL STREET Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Comfortable Home, Big Block with Great Shedding & Supreme Convenience!
When comfort, security and convenience are key factors for your next home, you will want this one at the top of your list. This terrific three bedroom home will be so much fun to live in. You can spread out in style in the huge versatile space upstairs or if you prefer entertaining alfresco there's always the large pergola right at the back door. The landscaped block is a very comfortable size at almost a quarter of an acre and infrastructure includes not only the home but also two good sized sheds safe and sound within excellent colorbond fencing. On top of this you will find yourself just a short walk from either Lansell Square or the shopping district in Kangaroo Flat with great access to the freeway or train station for a short commute to Melbourne, Castlemaine etcetera.
The home itself has everything you need on the ground floor including three bedrooms with built-in-robes, two of which have reverse cycle split systems for personal heating and cooling, these rooms are serviced by a clean modern three piece bathroom and the separate loo which we all know is ideal. The laundry is a very clever use of space tucked away behind sliding doors in true European style. A small hallway from the pretty front door provides privacy to the lounge room where you are kept comfortable with ducted heating and cooling, and this opens onto the kitchen so refreshments during your favourite shows are close and handy.
The pristine kitchen is equipped with stainless steel appliances including the dishwasher and rangehood, the built-in-pantry is just what you need and the gorgeous timber benchtop highlights the lovely colonial windows and French-doors which open from the dining area directly onto the beautiful concreted outdoor entertaining area under a large pergola with its own ceiling fan, just looking at it, it's easy to imagine the fun times to be had and memories to be made.
The same can be said of the huge upstairs room, again with a reverse cycle split system and the stairway also conveniently adjoining the kitchen-dining area. This is such a big space with almost a full wall of windows for an elevated treetop outlook, that it inspires thoughts of a theatre room or fantastic party room, a games room for the kids (or for the big kids), a parents retreat.... let your imagination run wild. Also one of the windows was a sliding door so maybe you'd like to reinstate a balcony?
The block is landscaped with bark chips in the front yard, well established leafy green low maintenance plants, some lawn for a soft play area out the back where you can watch the kids and pets from the kitchen, pergola or either one of the two great sheds that will be the reason he wants this house. One of the sheds is a huge 6 x 12 metres and the other is the original mancave, both have concrete floors, power and lights, but you won't need to take up your shed space for your day to day cars as a double carport under the rumpus room takes care of that.
Furthermore when convenience matters this one takes the cake. Just a short walk to Lansell Square or the shopping strip in central Kangaroo Flat with every amenity you could hope for plus a few more. Not to mention the added benefit of being on the Melbourne side of Bendigo and ideally positioned one street back from the main road offering a quite spot with great freeway access, or if you prefer public transport you're not far from the train station for a quick commute to Melbourne if you like.
If you can't make the open you should call the agent for a private inspection, she's always happy to help and properties like this go fast.
