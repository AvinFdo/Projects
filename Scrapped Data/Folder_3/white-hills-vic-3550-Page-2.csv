1960s stylish home with contemporary modern updates.
The 1960s gave us pocket transistor radios, psychedelic coloured mini skirts, bold furniture and semi-modern brick veneer homes.

It features amazing light-filled spaces including big entry foyer, large hallway, four bedrooms, generous main with new ensuite, and 3 other bedrooms with wall to floor built in robes, new large 3 piece family bathroom, beautiful large formal lounge with bay window and gas heater in a brick feature wall. The new kitchen boasts gas/electric cooking appliances, dishwasher, island bench/breakfast bar, good storage including pantry and spacious dining area all bathed in northern light.
Next to this is a great family /rumpus room, hardwood timber flooring with double French door access to a front patio and double doors to brilliant outdoor living highlighting covered and pergola areas overlooking the well-sized back garden
Added features include high ceilings, decorative 1960s cornicing, polished timber floors, two split system air conditioners, gas heating, storage cupboards tucked into every available space, wrought iron balustrade to the front terrace, double carport and garden shed.
Set on a corner allotment (approx 1017m²) the big backyard has side access and room to add shedding or a pool if desired, or plenty of room for the caravan, boat etc.
Well-located close to everything one looks for when buying property schools, public transport, local shops and cafes, medical facilities and the stunning Bendigo Botanic Gardens.

Situated in the tightly held suburb of White Hills is this large 1449m2 parcel of land offering the discerning buyer a desirable location to reside or invest. Set back and secluded from the road thanks to the private driveway, the block opens at the rear to your very own blank canvass, where you can decide to build your family home or develop further for profit (STCA).
The main section of the block measures a very generous 36m x 34m (approx.), where there is relatively flat and cleared ground to work with. There are some existing trees to break up the monotony, throwing shade at certain times of the day. All services are available at street level, meaning it is ready to start building on immediately.
Tucked away in a quiet residential pocket and close to White Hills amenities including the delightful Botanical Gardens and the White Hills Primary school, this sizeable parcel of land is yours to snap up immediately!","SOLD - $210,000","1,449m²",Vacant land,Sold by private treaty 18 May 2020,"126 St Killian Street, White Hills VIC 3550 was last sold in 2020.","ALL

Stage 2 of this exciting, rare opportunity to reside within 1.2 km of the lake precinct and within 3 km's of Bendigo's CBD is now available - but be quick! An excellent choice of lots ranging from 382 m2 to 661 m2 with several offering north facing rear yards and 14mt of existing rear fencing. Just 1.2km to Lake Weeroona, this singular new sub-division of sprawling proportions so close to central Bendigo, is also close to the new hospital. With 43 lots in total, over half of Stage 1 has already been sold with building having commenced on several lots. Mostly level and some with optimal north-facing backyards adds to the lengthy list of reasons to choose yours now! Low-maintenance living allows weekends focused on leisure activities instead of mowing. Ride or walk nearby Bendigo Creek Trail or Axedale Rail Trail. Take up rowing on the lake, or catch a bus out the front of the estate into the CBD for shopping, theatre events, Art Gallery visits or simply a Sunday cafe crawl. Landscaped nature strips visually enhance the habitat, along with peaceful reserves. An access road at the rear, connects to Grace Street, providing a secondary entry and exit point. Backing onto Weeroona Secondary College sports oval adds further convenience. New Vic Roads works in Napier St will add a median strip at the front of the estate, allowing for safer entry and exit and convenient u-turn lanes to get you back to CBD. Certain to be in high demand.","SOLD - $145,000",382m²,Vacant land,Sold by private treaty 6 May 2020,0,"ALL

white-hills-vic-3550,19 Plumridge Street White Hills VIC 3550,"COTTAGE CHARM IN AN ENVIABLE POSITION!
Situated in a sought-after White Hills position is this historic, character-filled and architect-influenced brick cottage offering scope as your own home, investment or supplementary income (yes, it is currently used for short-term accommodation - with constant clients).
Walk to Bendigo Creek walking tracks, schools and all the local shops, but best of all it is a stroll to White Hills Gardens and all the lovely features on offer there after its recent facelift.
The home boasts a superb custom-built kitchen with period-style cupboards, slate tiled floor, pot-drawers, walk-in pantry, dishwasher, gas hot plates and electric oven, ample bench space and a quirky microwave cavity; adjacent is the living area boasting a large reverse-cycle split-system, quality carpet and French Doors leading to the spacious, private alfresco space.
The dining room is cosy, features a slate floor and flows easily to the kitchen, it would also make a great private second living space. The three bedrooms are large, the main bedroom has its own reverse-cycle split system and a walk-in-robe; there's a second entry/foyer which would make a great study space and there is ample storage including a large walk-in linen press.
The bathroom is unique in shape and style, boasting a lovely claw-foot bath, large inset shower and a vanity basin made from a vintage timber cabinet; the laundry is of a similar taste to the bathroom and has outside access, adjacent is the separate toilet.
Outside is minimal maintenance with a private side yard with some foliage, a pond feature, paved brick and bluestone paths surrounding the home, local quarry rock retaining walls and a large paved area at the rear of the home which encompasses the covered alfresco space.
There is a shed/workshop with concrete floor, benches and built-in pegboard, a water tank and some additional storage.
The home has been re-floored, re-roofed and re-wired - you literally can walk in and do nothing; period features include pine-lined ceilings, feature brick walls (yes, the home is double brick), open fire places and an overall unique kerbside look and floor plan.
Worth viewing - it is one-of-a-kind in a one-of-a-kind location.","SOLD - $338,000","3
