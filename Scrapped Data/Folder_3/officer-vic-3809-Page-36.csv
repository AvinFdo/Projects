officer-vic-3809,122 STEPHENS ROAD Officer VIC 3809,"For Lands Sake!
30 Acres (approx) of Prime Real Estate right in the heart of Officer. The property is zoned Urban Growth with no overlays. The property also offers two road frontages 360m to Handford Lane and 330m to Stephens Road. Only 200m off Princes freeway. The property is located with the Officer South Employment Precinct Structure Plan (PSP) and is earmarked to be mixed business and residential. The Victoria Planning Authority (VPA) is in the early stages of scoping for the Officer South Employment Precinct Structure Plan within the Cardinia Shire Council, which is expected to commence in the second half of 2017. The property is about 12 Hectares and the asking price is $6,000,000 which works out to about $500,000 per hectare or $50 per square meter. We are expecting the PSP will be approved within 2 to 3 years. With other developments that are PSP approved fetching $1,000,000 per hectare you can clearly see there is good value in this site. Get in early as these prices are sure to rise. For more information please call Matt Koster on 0474 781 711
