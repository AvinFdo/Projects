south-yarra-vic-3141,20 Mona Place South Yarra VIC 3141,"'Caslake House'
CASLAKE HOUSE reflects the architectural artistry for which homes by Marcus Martin remain so instantly recognizable, so widely regarded and so highly sought after. Martin's confidence to adopt a style based on restraint and subtlety has been complemented throughout this landmark residence by the light yet comprehensive approach taken to renovation by renowned Melbourne architects Powell & Glenn - with evident, exceptional success. The care taken to preserve the integrity of the home's original elements while entirely updating its inviting spaces creates a mood that's at once classical and contemporary, simultaneously refined yet relaxed. Fabulous formal rooms for living, dining and entertaining, a study and brilliant dimensions for everyday family life are arranged around a central kitchen featuring first class finishes, bespoke Peter Cole benches and a huge walk-in pantry. Four welcoming, luxurious bedrooms, one currently configured as a superb studio, are accompanied on the upstairs level by two beautiful bathrooms and a pair of brilliant balconies, further enhancing the allure of a home that's surrounded by gardens where landscape designer Kate Seddon's sublime skill ensures peace, privacy and perfection. Double garaging completes a memorable Martin property - and enhances an unforgettable Melbourne home - moments from the Royal Botanic Gardens, elite private schools, Toorak Road restaurants, tram routes, the Yarra River and bike tracks to the city.","SOLD - $8,000,000","4
