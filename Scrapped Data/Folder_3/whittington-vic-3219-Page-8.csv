whittington-vic-3219,2 Katarina Place Whittington VIC 3219,"Why Pay for Big?
This is the ideal townhouse to start out in or downsize to. It's on its' own title, it's low maintenance, it's on the corner of a quiet court and it's a great price. Walk into the lounge and you'll feel right at home. With the economy of gas heating and a ceiling fan, you'll be comfortable all year round. Relax on the couch and ponder life as you gaze out of the floor to ceiling windows to the world outside. Both bedrooms have built-in robes and are located at the far end of the home, with the convenience of the bathroom and separate toilet nearby. The cute kitchen is compact but still has plenty of storage. With everything in easy reach, you'll be happy to spend time cooking up a storm. The dining area adjoins the kitchen and is large enough to host dinners when family and friends come to visit. Air conditioning and a ceiling fan means things will never get too heated. The sliding door in the dining area leads out to an enclosed, private paved area. Build a fernery, add some lounges and make it your own sanctuary to escape the hustle and bustle of the every day. The front garden is big enough to satisfy your green thumb but small enough that you can maintain it yourself. With a single garage alongside, a potential rental return of $250-$270 and a block size of 280sqm, this one is definitely worth a look. Contact us to register your interest.","SOLD - $295,000","2
