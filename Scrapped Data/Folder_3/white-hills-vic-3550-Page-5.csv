white-hills-vic-3550,49 Raglan Street White Hills VIC 3550,"Compact and Complete
Blending character with clean, crisp lines of contemporary styling, this 3 bedroom home has been refreshed and is ready to revel in. Compact and complete, it offers a fuss-free lifestyle in close proximity to all kinds of local conveniences and attractions.
Recently repainted and featuring ducted heating and cooling, it's as warm in the winter as it is cool in the summertime. A resplendent kitchen with stainless steel oven and ceramic cooktop sit amongst loads of bench space, ample cupboards and pot-drawers. Beautiful bathroom fittings include a clawfoot slipper tub creating a surprisingly complementary contrast combined with modern vanity and tiling.
The living room is a great size at 6.2 metres long and has wide corner windows to welcome morning sunshine inside. Take advantage of the quiet street by adding green screens to the broad side patio at the entrance for a lovely outdoor living area.
Fully fenced in Colourbond panels, the property also has a small rear yard to secure pets and little people, plus off-street parking for one vehicle. But you can leave that car at home, as so much is within walking distance. Stroll to schools, college, medical practice, pharmacy, post office, hairdresser, pool, botanic gardens, pub, footy, clothing alterations, racecourse, golf, cafe, takeaway, butcher and baker. No candlestick maker, but there is a kindergarten 260 metres up the road and buses around the corner. It's only a 7 minute drive or 12 minute bike ride into the heart of the city to make life at this fabulous address even easier.
This home could potentially achieve a rental return of between $310 and $320 per week.

white-hills-vic-3550,11 Waratah Street White Hills VIC 3550,"Affordable Living in a Popular Location
Recapturing the elegance of period heritage, a wealth of character graces the interior of this quaint cottage behind its white picket fence. However, modern needs must also be met as they have been here, with kitchen and bathroom essentials in place.
Restored to glory with a rich colour palette infusing warmth, features abound beneath high ceilings with embellished cornices. Adding to the grandeur, corbelled mantels surround fireplaces, deep pelmets top drapes, leadlight shades and chandeliers adorn lights. The dining room owns the charm of floorboards and a lovely wood fire heats the lounge. In the kitchen, solid timber cabinetry fittingly recreates the scene, while a low profile ceramic cooktop resides in synergy.
An entire wall of built-in robes in the main bedroom, lengthy linen press and large pantry are a big bonus in a home of this era. All 3 bedrooms are carpeted and serviced by an updated bathroom and separate toilet. Through the sliding door you'll find a backyard with a huge covered alfresco area and garage with ample space for a workshop. Lawn is edged by garden beds planted with shrubs and trees bordered by good fencing.
It's just 4 minutes' walk to Weeroona College, 20 minutes' stroll to school, shops, lake and hospital. The CBD is only 4 minutes' drive or skip the parking blues, jump on a bike and be there in less than 10 minutes!","SOLD - $277,000","3

Nothing beats a good floor plan and this innovative home is full of interesting angles, generous spaces and quality fittings.
A low maintenance terraced front garden leads to the front portico with wide, tiled entry hall flanked by a large formal lounge on one side and guest bedroom/home office opposite.
Next up, the hub of the home incorporates family living and dining areas with a surprisingly spacious kitchen tucked behind a wide waterfall island bench/breakfast bar. With LG gas/electric range, dishwasher, plumbed double fridge space and large walk-in pantry, it ticks all the boxes.
The laundry includes storage and access to the garage before heading through double glass doors to outside.
The hallway is home to two more great-sized bedrooms with robes and one with convenient access to the main bathroom, before it opens to the main suite complete with external access, fully-fitted walk-in robe and spacious ensuite boasting twin vanity basins, separate WC, good storage and big walk-in shower.
Who doesn't love living outdoors and this alfresco entertaining area beckons whatever the weather. Under the roofline, the paved L-shaped area includes heating and cooling from the house and roll-down blinds providing protection from the sun or inclement weather making it perfect for year-round outdoor living.
In summer, the kids can splash about in the slimline 7metre pool while you entertain in absolute comfort.
Quality extras include extensive floor tiling, ducted heating, cooling and vacuum systems, square-set cornice, gas barbecue and sound system to alfresco, external shower, self-cleaning pool, three-car auto garage and side access to Colorbond shed approx 15m x 5.5 m x 4.2m high with paved driveway.
Immaculately presented and sited on a block approx. 804 square metres in a quiet, family-friendly neighbourhood, this one is worth a long, hard look.","SOLD - $700,000","4

white-hills-vic-3550,124 St Killian Street White Hills VIC 3550,"SO MUCH TO LOVE HERE
Located in a quiet back street of White Hills amongst a lovely back drop of gum trees is this extremely appealing 1950's brick home, ideal for first home buyers, downsizers and young families alike! Rendered on the exterior and tastefully updated on the inside, the home has seen some modern improvements in recent times whilst thankfully retaining its original character and charm - the type of charm that will have you hooked on first inspection!
Set on a quarter acre allotment (1012m2) with a lovely curb side presence, you would be forgiven for thinking you were in a quiet country town and not 5 minutes from the major regional city of Bendigo! A short walk to the picturesque Botanical Gardens and in close proximity to White Hills amenities, the quiet location is peaceful yet convenient at the same time!
The internal floor plan is functional and spacious, and in terrific order throughout. There are three sizeable bedrooms, two with built in robes and the huge master suite with walk in robe and its own ensuite. A second bathroom fits nicely between the two remaining bedrooms, whilst the renovated laundry has good storage. Ducted heating and cooling control the temperature throughout the home, whilst the 1.5kw solar panel system provides some welcome relief from those expensive power bills. The main feature of the home is definitely the light filled kitchen, dining and living space. Central to all, this expansive area will absolutely delight! The beautiful exposed brick chimney separates the spacious living area and dining space, which is adjacent to the well appointed kitchen. Boasting all the mod cons including dishwasher, stone top island bench, loads of storage, and updated free standing cooking facilities, this delightful area is a treat for the household chef!
Outside, the separate bungalow adds another dimension to the property as a fourth bedroom, studio or home office. There is fantastic shedding available to the tradesman, car enthusiast or home handy man to tinker. There is a covered and semi enclosed deck area the will please lovers of outdoor entertaining, plus a paved courtyard to enjoy in the warmer months. The double carport at the front sits in front of double gates which provide access to the rear for a caravan boat or trailer, where there is a third carport to park any of your spare toys
So much to love here, this property will suitably impress a number of quality home seekers. A hotly contested market should see a quick result, so call now to avoid any disappointment.","SOLD - $400,000","3
