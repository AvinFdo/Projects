Designed and executed to entertain all the family needs, you will have a choice of three separate living zones.
As you enter you will love this impressive modern façade, wide entrance hall and high ceilings throughout the home.
At the front of the home boasts the oversized master bedroom which includes full ensuite and walk in robe. To the right of the hall you will find one of the living zones which could be easily be converted into a full threate room space. Moving through to the heart of the home is the open plan main living and dining zone that is enhanced with the natural light beaming in. The gourmet kitchen overlooks this zone and features stone benchtop, 900mm oven, dishwasher, WIP and plenty of storage space.
Conveniently located in a separate wing of the home is the additional bedrooms which all include BIRs and are serviced by the main bathroom. The third living zone provides a great space for a kids play area or a traditional lounge setting. Both the main zone and this area have sliding doors that flow out onto a large undercover alfresco and massive backyard giving enough room to entertain and the kids to play. An added bonus of the backyard is site gate access which is great for those with a trailer, boat or caravan.
There is simply not enough homes that come onto the market of this calibre and size, and this is not an opportunity to be missed.
Added features include but are not limited large laundry, evaporative cooling, ducted heating, remote controlled double garage, block out blinds, beautiful gardens and much more.

officer-vic-3809,53 Grant Parade Officer VIC 3809,"ONE OF THE BIGGEST IN TIMBERTOP
""You have to click through the photos - it's so much bigger than you think.""
Five huge bedrooms! And I mean, huge (check out the measurements on each). Four living areas. Plus a 512sqm block with large side access making it one of the biggest blocks released in the early stages of Timbertop - perfect for anyone with a caravan, boat or trailer. It's also a massive money-winner for anyone with eyes on future growth (see below for further info).
Located in Officer's premier estate, the delightful two-storey home is only a few metres up from Timbertop Primary School (opening in 2021) and located close to public transport, parkland and shopping facilities.
It's also very close to St. Brigid's Primary School, Beaconsfield Primary school plus St Francis College and Minaret College.
Only a few years old the property features:
- Five bedrooms, master with en-suite and walk-in robe. Did we mention the size of the bedrooms yet?
- Designated study area;
- Theatre room;
- Formal living area;
- Rumpus room;
- Open plan living/dining zone;
- Modern kitchen with stone waterfall bench tops that wraps around the cabinets;
- Downlights and feature pendant lighting;
- Double car garage with remote control access;
- Alarm system;
- Zoned ducted heating and refrigerated cooling;
- Huge backyard that could be accessed from the street;
- The side access is perfect for anyone with a caravan, boat or trailer.
According to Australia's number one real estate source, ***, five bedroom properties in Officer averaged a median sale price of $750,000 over the last financial year. This is nearly $200,000 more than what four bedroom properties were averaging over the same span.
So when you make 53 Grant Parade your next purchase you're not only doing it for the lifestyle that a property like this brings but you're also doing it with an eye to future financial growth.
