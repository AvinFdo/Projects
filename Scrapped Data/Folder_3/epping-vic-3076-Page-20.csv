epping-vic-3076,12 Prism Walk Epping VIC 3076,"Open-Plan is the Best Plan
Whether youre looking for an undeniably stylish first home, a savvy investment opportunity or an irresistible lock-and-leave, 12 Prism Walk in Epping has you covered. Located in a 6-star estate this 3-bed, 2-bath home brings to the fore the concepts of comfort and convenience, all in a solidly-built package.
The bold façade combines elements of timber, exposed brick and render in a tantalising manner, inviting you indoors where youll be met by the three surprisingly large bedrooms. Lush carpeting, stylish feature walls and bucket loads of natural light add a touch of luxury, which is ably complemented by the walk-in-robes to each room and the full ensuite to the master. A second, main bathroom has a bathtub and shower, and the separate internal laundry is a well-thought-out touch.
The open-plan kitchen is spacious and contemporary, with ample bench space, high ceilings and all the mod-cons you may need. It adjoins the living and meals area, which in term open out onto one of the standout features of the home: the covered, decked entertaining area. Spacious and eye-catching, this is destined to be the social centre of the home. A set of stairs takes you down to the double remote garage, accessed via a private laneway at the back.
Well insulated, with ducted heating and split-system cooling, this property is equipped for all seasons. Its located directly across the road from up-market tennis courts (free to use!), and there are a number of parks, schools and shops within easy reach.
A home like this with fibre-optic internet and no body corporate fees wont be on the market long!","SOLD - $459,950","3
