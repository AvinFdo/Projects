officer-vic-3809,40 Armytage Road Officer VIC 3809,"4 ACRES OF PARKLIKE SERENITY - SUPERB HOME, AMAZING SHEDS & GARDENS.
Nestled into a secluded, semi-rural setting north of the highway offering true peace and tranquility whilst being a moments’ drive from urban services. The property features a contemporary styled four bedroom home with an apron of lush greenery complimenting it to stunning effect. Light filled and north facing, the home exudes character and warmth throughout. Its main sandstone floored living area opens to a superb entertainment terrace and a further semi enclosed alfresco area features a traditional clay pizza oven and BBQ area for large family gatherings. Back inside, the granite benched kitchen features stainless steel appliances, crisp off white cabinetry and plentiful storage. The master suite is segregated from remaining bedrooms, with two of these in a separate ‘wing’ complete with guests or children’s lounge between them. Bathrooms are chic and contemporary and the home boasts top quality ducted refrigerated air conditioning and wonderful gas fired hydronic panel heaters throughout (the Rolls Royce of heating systems). The property is protected by state of the art video surveillance/alarm systems and a stately, stone pillared electric entry gate way. Both mains and tank water service the property and drought tolerant lawns retain a year round rich green appearance. The shedding is something out of the ordinary and includes a 12 x 7.6 workshop and a further 18 x 7.6 machinery shed with toilet/bathroom plus various poultry/bird enclosures that the present owners use for their thriving hobby based enterprise. These improvements could be utilized for a variety of uses but will particularly interest the bird fanciers out there!
Agent’s Note: A property that is fully established, meticulously maintained and a ready for a new owner to benefit from its present owners many years of effort and expense.","SOLD - $1,230,000","4
