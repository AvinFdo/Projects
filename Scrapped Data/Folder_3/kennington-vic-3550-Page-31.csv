kennington-vic-3550,5 Carola Court KENNINGTON VIC 3550,"MAKE IT YOUR OWN
Nestled at the end of a quiet court, in one of Bendigo's most sought after locations, this three-bedroom ranch-style home is perfectly priced for a first-home buyer or investor. There are many reasons why Kennington is so popular with home owners - the proximity to schools and shops, the short hop to the CBD, the safe and leafy streetscapes. The home comprises three large bedrooms, main with ensuite and WIR, formal lounge room with solid-fuel heating, kitchen/meals area with stainless steel appliances, large pantry and gas heating. Evaporative cooling is ducted throughout the home. The rear verandah links, via glass doors, to a huge solid-brick garage. There are also rollers to both the driveway and the backyard so that the whole space can open up to become a versatile undercover entertaining area. When it's not being used for parties, it's the perfect workshop and can also easily accommodate three vehicles. The backyard has both lawn and established gardens, including olive trees laden with fruit. Whether you plan to invest or put your own stamp on this family home, the potential is ripe.","SOLD - $344,000","3

The island bench is finished with a granite overlay, has a breakfast bar, and water views. A meals area is adjacent and overlooks a large family room on the next level. Sliding doors open to a fabulous decked entertaining area, again with water views, and featuring a stylish leaf wall sculpture. Timber stairs lead to the main bedroom with its walk-in wardrobe, three-piece en suite and front row' balcony views.
