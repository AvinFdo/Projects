This stylish home is perfectly positioned in the ever-popular Timbertop Estate, built to the highest standard by a private builder, you will not be disappointed at every premium fitting that has been put into this home. Upon entry you are greeted with a modern rendered façade, a wide airy hallway that leads you through to the heart of the home, whilst giving the feeling of style and sophistication highlighting its high-end fittings and finishes along the way. The vast master bedroom is located at the front of the home featuring dressing room and hotel-inspired ensuite bathroom with separate toilet. This package has it all, 2 separate sizeable living zones and a beautiful central kitchen with caesarstone benches, double oven, induction hotplates and walk-in-pantry. Two further generous bedrooms with built in robes and separate study nook are quietly situated off the hallway. One of the secondary bedrooms has direct access to the main bathroom, so visitors and teenagers will never want to leave!
