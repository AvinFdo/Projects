south-yarra-vic-3141,2/43-49 Clowes Street South Yarra VIC 3141,"Townhouse Excellence in Botanic Gardens Precinct - Enter via Walsh Street
A unique home of refined and urbane sophistication, this generously proportioned, two bedroom, townhouse is positioned in one of South Yarra's most prestigious streets, within metres of the Botanical Gardens and the Yarra River. Renovated with an exquisite and tasteful sense of visual impact, the home is part of a rarely-offered boutique block and promises to be a joy to live in.
A vast timber kitchen bench creates a compelling contrast to stainless steel benches and SMEG appliances in a gourmet kitchen that overlooks a generous open-plan lounge/dining. Full-width windows and glass sliding doors introduce a beautiful private courtyard and a welcome flood of natural light, while upstairs, the master bedroom features enormous triple-width built-in robes and the second bedroom enjoys the benefit of a study nook as well as more built-in robes. Meanwhile, the bathroom exudes the feel of a luxury hotel, renovated with marble surfaces, plus there is a European laundry and secure basement parking, which is a genuine privilege in this thriving location.
Central to everything, this really is the quintessential inner-urban lifestyle location. You can wander the Botanical Gardens, run 'The Tan', make your way to Chapel St for some nightlife or enjoy the ability to walk to the CBD along the banks of the Yarra River...it's all at your doorstep.","SOLD - $1,076,500","2
