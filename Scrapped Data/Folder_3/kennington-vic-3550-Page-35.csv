kennington-vic-3550,12 Lowndes Street Kennington VIC 3550,"More Than Meets The Eye
Don't be deceived, this well-presented home is much more than the modest brick veneer it appears from the outside, it has been cleverly extended and renovated to provide a multi-roomed home with a multitude of possible uses.
Inside there are five bedrooms (four with robes) plus a study, three bathrooms and two big living areas.
Add to this a family-sized kitchen with all mod cons, and a dining area to match. With ducted heating/cooling and storage at a premium throughout, there's ample room for a for a really large family where everyone can have a room to call their own.
Alternatively, it could be easily converted to provide a separate wing for live-in relatives or boarders. It would be ideal as student accommodation or a small backpackers hostel and is also suitable for professional rooms (STCA) with angle parking at the front door.
Externally it offers a covered outdoor living area, concrete paved driveway to a double carport and double garage set in easy-care gardens with secure fencing.
Located in the very heart of Kennington and directly opposite a small shopping strip including milk bar/takeaway, hairdresser, butcher, chemist and doctor's surgery. If that's not enough, there are both private and state primary schools within easy walking distance and a slightly longer walk will take you to the university, the city and supermarkets.
This is a rare chance to secure a unique property in a premium position for living in, letting out or launching a new business.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"5
