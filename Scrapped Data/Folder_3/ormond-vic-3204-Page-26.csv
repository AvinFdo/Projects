Effortless designer style and sophisticated presentation give this rear, ground-floor contemporary apartment a leading edge. In a striking development with the accent on relaxed urban living, the apartment has a surprising large open-plan living room (with sleek kitchen) where sunlight streams in through a wall of glass that makes the big private courtyard like another living area. The 2 double bedrooms have mirror-fronted BIRs and their own private balconies. Refinements such as lift access from the secure basement car park (with storage cage), intercom entry, split-system A/C, and Euro laundry add to the amenity and enhance the lifestyle on offer. The location is great, too - stroll to Ormond shops, cafes, businesses, trains and buses; enjoy nearby recreational facilities; be handy to schools and Monash Uni (Caulfield).

ormond-vic-3204,1/30 Lillimur Road ORMOND VIC 3204,"Chic style & a private courtyard
How about a modern ground-floor apartment with large glass doors opening out to a private front courtyard-style garden where there's ample space to relax or entertain in the sunshine? With the doors open it makes the living room one with the outdoors and adds to the casual peaceful ambience of a cleverly designed, low maintenance home. The kitchen - stylish with its lime-washed cabinetry, glass splashback, smooth-top hot plates, stone benchtops, and stainless steel appliances - is part of the open plan living room (rev-cyc A/C). The 2 bedrooms have BIRs - the master bedroom having its own small courtyard and dual-access to the bathroom with Euro laundry. Extras include secure basement car park and storage locker. The location is highly convenient to Ormond shops, cafes, trains, buses, reserves and recreation.
