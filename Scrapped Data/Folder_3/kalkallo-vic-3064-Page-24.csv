kalkallo-vic-3064,24 Golf Links Drive Beveridge VIC 3753,"Walk to the Club House
Private inspections available - The best part about Mandalay is being able to use the facilities provided such as the swimming pool, gymnasium, restaurant and of course the award winning golf course. But how often will you use these facilities when you live so far away from them? Obviously it stands to reason that the more convenient they are, the more likely you will us them; that's why this great home is set above most others in the estate on location. You are a leisurely stroll away from a round of golf, dinner with friends and your morning workout, but location is only a part of the home buying puzzle and there is far more to attract you to this home than just its address. With a large backyard with plenty of side access (enough to fit a boat, car, caravan or all of the above), the pets and kids will have room to move.
Internally the large living space is terrific but for those moments you want to be by yourself, a second living area at the front of the home may be more your cup of tea. With other creature comforts such as gas ducted heating, evaporative cooling, high ceilings and internal access from the garage, this could well be the home (and location) you have been searching for.","SOLD - $520,000","4
