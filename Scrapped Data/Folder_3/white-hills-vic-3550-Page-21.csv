white-hills-vic-3550,19 Waratah Street WHITE HILLS VIC 3550,"REDUCED TO SELL AT $200,000
Remember the old adage about books and covers? This is a classic example; the modest home has been totally transformed internally to create light, bright and very comfortable spaces with the latest in fittings and appliances. The fully renovated kitchen is now a white delight with stainless steel under-bench electric oven, ceramic hotplate, dishwasher, plenty of cabinetry and room for a dining table.
The open plan living area includes room for formal dining if desired. The main bedroom has a wall of mirror-fronted robes while the second bedroom overlooks the rear garden and the renewed bathroom includes glass shower and modern vanity. Fresh, clean paintwork, modern floor coverings, gas heating and air conditioner add to the appeal of this very affordable home.
Set on a block about 540 square metres, it includes a securely fenced and neat backyard, garden shed, a studio/workshop and a double carport on the side which could double as an outdoor living area. Walk to Weeroona College, public transport and the exciting new hospital precinct, this is a spotless property ideal for first home buyers or retirees.
Definitely don't decide till you've seen inside.

white-hills-vic-3550,7A Cambridge Crescent WHITE HILLS VIC 3550,"First Home Opportunity or Ideal Investment
Tucked away off the main road yet only minutes from the CBD and convenient to all amenities,
this three-bedroom brick-veneer home is an excellent buy.
Primary and secondary schools, a post office, chemist and other shops are all close by and there's a bus route on Napier Street.
It would suit a range of buyers from a professional couple, to downsizers, investors and first home buyers.
Double gates on the driveway open to a single carport, while further in, there's a large shed with a concrete floor and power.
From the verandah, a front door opens to a good-size lounge room which has a wall-mounted air-conditioner. Through a wide opening is a kitchen and dining area with a suede-finish feature wall. The kitchen has an upright gas stove, and plenty of storage space above and below the benchtops.
A hallway extends from the kitchen to the three bedrooms. All have built-in wardrobes and ceiling fans while one has a wall-mounted air-conditioner. Ducted heating is throughout the home as well.
Also along the hallway are two-door linen storage, a four-piece bathroom and a laundry that opens to an outside ramp, under a second verandah, leading to the back garden. A garden shed with a concrete floor is another addition in the low-maintenance back garden where a number of fruit trees are happily growing, including apple, peach and apricot.
This is a great opportunity to buy a well-priced home and make it your own.","SOLD - $247,500","3

white-hills-vic-3550,10 Cambridge Crescent WHITE HILLS VIC 3550,"Victorian Fantasy
Only a short drive from the CBD, in the heart of White Hills, is this three-bedroom weatherboard Victorian home that oozes character and charm and lots of potential.
All it needs from a first home buyer, family or a renovator is some imagination and work to maximise its features and possibilities.
Lofty pine-lined ceilings edged by deep glossy-white cornices are still intact, likewise three graceful arches, ceiling roses, skirting boards, dado pine walls and a central brick fireplace, now resplendent with a gas log fire in the living room, with an archway either side.
The home has 3 bedrooms along a central hallway, and a large living room at the front of the house that could easily be converted to a fourth bedroom.
An inviting country-style kitchen has a gas upright stove set into the original fireplace, room for a dining setting, and timber benchtops and cupboards.
Theres a vestibule at the rear of the home with a three-piece bathroom at one end, featuring a delightful stained-glass window (theres a matching one above the front door) and a laundry and separate toilet at the other.
The back door opens to a good sized verandah and an open backyard ideal for small children and pets and with its north-facing aspect, its a good place to grow vegies or start a garden.
A double carport is on the driveway and behind this is a 6 x 5-metre shed with concrete floor and power, a single roller door and single-door access to the backyard.
The White Hills shops and schools are close by and theres a bus to the CBD also. What are you waiting for?
