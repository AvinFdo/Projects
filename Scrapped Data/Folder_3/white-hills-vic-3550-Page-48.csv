A little history
Honeysuckle Street is one of several streets laid out in c1854 to be given a ""Floral"" name. The owner builder of this home was John McCraw, a ""miner' from Scotland and the home was built around c1873. John was first mate onboard the ship ""Omega"" when it sailed from Plymoth on 29th May 1852. (John was 26 years of age). On board the ship was Isabella Sneddon (19 years of age) and other members of her family. John and Isabella were married in 1853 in South Australia and moved to Victoria in 1854. Records have them living in a frame tenement and canvas tent with 6 children in the Honeysuckle Street location up until they purchased the lot at Auction on the 15th May 1871 and commenced building the house. They eventually had a family of 10 children. The house was passed down through the family until sold in 1992.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"3

NOTE: the vendors are after a quick sale - price has been adjusted - now great value at $175,000.

All services are readily available to this block.
The location is terrific, only 2 minutes approx to so much - including Strathfieldsaye shops, local Pub, Sports Ground - Football, Netball and Cricket clubs, Primary School, Regant Park playground, and Early Learning Centre - and is just a handy 6 minutes approx to Strath Village Shopping Centre, Aldi, High school and Uni.

white-hills-vic-3550,3 Shepperbottom Street California Gully VIC 3556,"IMMACULATE, SOLID BRICK 80s BUILD
This solid brick family home is positioned midway between Eaglehawk and the centre of Bendigo. Walking distance to bus stops and sporting oval, and located in a peaceful, established street, this well-maintained, beautifully presented property was built in the early 1980s and features character details of the era, including the post-modernism façade.
The front garden is neat and tidy with a wide covered porch leading to the entry. The door opens into a formal lounge, and double doors from this room direct you into an open plan living, kitchen and dining space. Exposed brick walls, archways and a built-in bar add retro charm, and the spacious kitchen offers a more contemporary finish with recently updated appliances and plenty of storage.
The master bedroom can be found off the main living area on one side. This large room features split system heating and cooling and a ceiling fan. A sizeable walk-through wardrobe separates the bedroom from the ensuite. On the other side of the central living area are two remaining bedrooms, both with built-in robes. This section of the home also offers a family bathroom, separate toilet, and laundry with access to the rear of the house.
Glass sliding doors from the main living open out to a large alfresco area ideal for year-round entertaining. This space overlooks a fernery and to one side is a fenced utility area. To the other side of the house is a lawn area with garden bed, a garden shed and a fenced space with raised garden beds the perfect set up for a veggie patch.

Split system heating and cooling throughout
Ceiling fans in all bedrooms
Gas wall heater in main living
Modern kitchen appliances including dishwasher, wall oven with separate grill and four-burner gas cooktop
