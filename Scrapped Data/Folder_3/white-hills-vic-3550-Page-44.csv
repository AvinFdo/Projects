Picture yourself sitting down in the cool of the day on the outdoor area overlooking the 8 acres and a beautiful dam with wild animals coming in for a drink.
This property is made for those people wanting a tree-change or a property where they can pursue some limited agricultural pursuits to encourage the land to continue to be people friendly.
It lends itself to lavender farming or olive growing. There is plenty of land around the family sized 4 bedroom house that can be continued to be developed as mainly a native garden to encourage the native fauna and a host of different birds.
Inside this steel framed home are 4 bedrooms of good size and a study.
There are two living rooms and a Shaker style kitchen with a huge dining area.
Also in this room is a wood fired stove for heating with comfy chairs to relax in on those cool wet days that can happen in winter.
The internal house is serviced by a built in ducted heating and cooling system to ensure your comfort all year round.
The house has had all older draperies removed and they are replaced by pull down blinds to control the heat etc; this makes the house suitable for those with breathing problems.
Outside there is a country style garden and five huge rainwater tanks to help with keeping the garden growing. There is a shed to accommodate three vehicles and storage as well as one that can take up to 10 vehicles, boats or be used as construction base for work-shopping. There is a tree
lined entry to the property of native trees which could be improved if necessary.
This property has many features which are well worth a look when considering your future place of living.

white-hills-vic-3550,Lot 2 Bendigo-St Arnaud Road Newbridge VIC 3551,"Fantastic Acreage Ideal For Grazing, Cropping or Viticulture
This is an excellent, and rare, opportunity to purchase land in the Newbridge community just 30km from Bendigos CBD and 170km from Melbourne.
At just over 200 acres, the allotment consists of two titles and includes permanent spring water of a drinkable quality.
Fronting the Wimmera Highway, the property is available to both single and 3-phase power and includes a good standard of fencing whilst the layout of the acreage also enjoys the option for an off-grid power supply using wind and solar technology.
The earth consists of a combination of deep black soils and volcanic basalt and the current owners have established a business yielding organic export and domestic hay, along with prime lamb production. The land is NASAA (#3720) certified organic farmland providing an outstanding opportunity to generate a diverse range of activities from horticulture to viticulture to grazing or, alternatively, sell to existing allotments or subdivide and on-sell land to lifestyle purchasers for residential development (STCA).
Positioned on the Wimmera Highway and with easy access to Newbridge, Bridgewater, Marong, Bendigo and Melbourne, this flexible opportunity will allow the buyer multiple options including the chance to continue farming a certified organic operation; convert to traditional farming or establish an alternative mixed farming enterprise. The practical location would also be ideal for transport operators seeking a depot, bulk handling facility or freight exchange set up.","SOLD - $370,000",82.96ha,Rural,Sold by private treaty 5 Aug 2020,0,0,https://www.domain.com.au/lot-2-bendigo-st-arnaud-road-newbridge-vic-3551-2014452005,,"Insights for Newbridge
