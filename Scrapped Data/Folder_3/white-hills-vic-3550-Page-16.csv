white-hills-vic-3550,6 Skibo Heights White Hills VIC 3550,"Exclusive and extraordinary
Constructed in 2012 by Russell Parsons, renowned for custom homes of supreme quality, this residence displays the WOW factor that befits its creator. Premium privacy is provided by a unique facade and an elevated position takes full advantage of lofty vistas over the surrounding area.
Immense room dimensions share an extravagance of space between open plan living, study and 3 bedrooms. The master bedroom contains an equally generous ensuite and walk-through robe hidden behind the bedhead wall. Victorian ash floors flow from front solid timber door to rear glass slider, past a wall of glass inviting a deluge of daylight indoors.
Topped with polished concrete, the island breakfast bar makes a robust statement in a superbly appointed kitchen. Greater ceiling height designates the living and dining area and similar zones are mirrored alfresco. Draped in the lush foliage of a grape vine, a pergola permits winter sunlight to penetrate inside but will elegantly deny summer sunshine. Alongside, a roof with ceiling fan shelters second outdoor entertaining space.
Concealing entry, an exterior feature wall disguises access to a double garage that also has direct internal access to the residence. In close proximity to Botanical Gardens, primary schools, local football ground, shopping centre plus public transport, a nearby walking track leads to most attractions and necessities.
Architecturally designed and situated in a well-respected area, this striking residence has the ability to leave an indelible impression. Astute purchasers seeking a stunning alternative to the average property would be wise to inspect before it's snapped up by others craving something truly special.

white-hills-vic-3550,50 Montgomery Crescent White Hills VIC 3550,"QUIET COURT POSITION
Great Value for money here in this Tiled roof home in a lovely family neighborhood. Three nice bedrooms one with BIRs. Very generous lounge with gas fire for those chilly winter nights.
Separate kitchen with room for dining table and good bench space and gas stove. Bathroom has a bath, vanity and separate tiled shower. Laundry leads to back vestibule handy for the kids boots. Outside a very nice rear garden and fully fenced for the kids or dogs to be safe in .
Single garage with enough room for workshop also, this has concrete floor.
This home would be an excellent buy if your kids are at Uni and you require a home for them for the next three years, or maybe add to your rental portfolio.
If you require to take up residence I can personally recommend the area as I once lived there. Walk down to the Bendigo Creek walking track, short bike ride for the kids to Weeroona College. Bus on highway to come into town
Forget paying the rent......

white-hills-vic-3550,34 Raglan Street White Hills VIC 3550,"Charming Modesty
The ever enduring lure of a white picket fence and iron-laced verandah remain to entice at this handy address. Stained glass windows and an open fireplace continue their charming presence, where 11' timber ceilings soar above Baltic pine floors. Gas heating and ducted cooling, plus a 900mm stainless steel cooker bring comfort and a little luxury indoors. The bathroom services 3 good-sized bedrooms and there's a multi-purpose room that could be a study or cosy second living area.
Simple yet sufficient to lend a rosy outlook, the sunny side garden has flexible prospects, whether screened to create a private retreat or utilised for extra off-street parking. Add a few pot plants and a splash of paving paint to the rear verandah, where a blank canvas inspires your preferred style of outdoor living.
A primary school sits just around the corner and it's only a 4 minute cycle to secondary college.
A nearby creek-side track also delivers a safe route into the CBD via Lake Weeroona in one direction, and Botanic Gardens park and pool in the other.
A short walk to shops and the bus stop into Bendigo adds even more convenience to this location.
Recent tenants who were paying $230 per week, have moved out allowing vacant possession.
Aluminium cladding, powder-coated front fence, new Colorbond fencing and on a compact allotment means minimal maintenance is required, ideal for busy people or investors.
Modest yet highly appealing, this property continues to possesses endearing allure.
