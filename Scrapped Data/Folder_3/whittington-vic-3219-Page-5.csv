whittington-vic-3219,4-6 Regent Street Whittington VIC 3219,"Impressive home and development site.
Lovingly restored with an inspired renovation this Edwardian family home is a treasure trove of history and perhaps the last of its kind on a massive 3256m2 allotment. Originally built in 1916 and transformed over the years to its current glorious state this residence is one of the best homes in the area and blends beautifully the classic era with the modern comforts. Internally, the home comprises four bedrooms plus study, quality kitchen, open plan dining area and generous sized living room, two bathrooms, large laundry, separate toilet and a huge undercover entertainment deck to the rear. The home boasts stunning ornate cornices, leadlight feature windows, open fire places with glorious mantles, polished timber floors and high ceilings. The family chef will love the kitchen which includes timber benches, a classic range stove cooker, dishwasher, loads of storage space and a pantry. The dining area also opens onto the rear veranda and undercover private alfresco area overlooking the huge garden. Additionally, the oversized single garages and carport lead into the huge workshop and storage area for all those keepsakes and hobbies or enthusiasts. With vegetable gardens and wine vines and plenty of fruit trees this property is an oasis so close the CBD. The huge development potential to subdivide the property (STCA) into multiple lots zoned General residential Zone -Schedule 1 and keep the beautiful existing property is an opportunity not to be missed. This property truly is one of the best and unique homes in the area and located just 9 mins to Geelong CBD 6 minutes to south Geelong railway station, 2 minute walk to bus services and a short walk to primary and secondary schools, Newcomb shopping centres and Gordon east Geelong campus.","SOLD - $1,050,000","4
