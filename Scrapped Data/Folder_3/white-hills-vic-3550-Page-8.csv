white-hills-vic-3550,6 Arbor Place White Hills VIC 3550,"Just what the family ordered!
Settled into a court, this youthful yet fully-established family home has all you need. Surprisingly under 4 kilometres from the city centre, it's also perfectly positioned to please busy mums and dads, tripping about between the plethora of priorities that come with parental bedlam!
Primary school is an 8 minute bike ride away, secondary just 13. Lake Weeroona a 30 minute wander and even puppy school is a few doors up the street! Bendigo Hospital is less than 3 kilometres for work or those inevitable expeditions to ER too!
Monochrome, minimalist styling allows whatever you wish to make your own dream decor come true here. Sleek sun-shades and blinds bring bright natural light indoors or shelter from summer's swelter, an efficient way to save energy!
Opposite master bedroom, the study would make an excellent temporary nursery using a screen. Appointed with good-sized walk-in robe, the main bedroom also has an unusual ensuite lay-out permitting a larger shower. Near the big family bathroom, 2 children's bedrooms have built-in robes.
Visually encompassing the hallway greatly expands lounge dimensions, leading through to open family zone. Lack of passageways reduces cost of running ducted heating and cooling. In a well-designed kitchen with dishwasher, gas cooktop and electric oven, an island breakfast bar is dedicated to casual meals and preparation rather than show-casing the sink.
Supplying ample space to play and entertain undercover of a generous alfresco area within a compact fenced yard, double garage, landscaping and more will no doubt add to having this home sold very soon!","SOLD - $380,000","3

white-hills-vic-3550,11 Grace Street White Hills VIC 3550,"Mid-century Marvel with Supberb Shedding
In a quiet street only minutes away from Lake Weeroona sits this charming cream brick veneer home with a red tiled roof, which is ready to be lived in, or renovated. The house comprises three generously-proportioned bedrooms with polished floorboards and ceiling fans, kitchen with ample bench and storage space, a three piece bathroom, and a second toilet located at the rear of the property. Keep cool in Summer and warm in Winter with ducted heating and cooling. Although the property is move-in ready, keen renovators will enjoy adding a modern twist internally while preserving the character-giving features of the property, including the original decorative cornices.
Externally, a double gate provides access to the fully-enclosed backyard where you will find a large pergola-protected entertaining area, along with a single-car carport, a garage with power connected, and a significant amount of open shedding. Alongside this is a well-maintained garden with established and thriving plants. This private yard provides the perfect space for you to entertain guests or simply enjoy the peaceful neighbourhood.
Take advantage of the close proximity of this home to schools and shops and its short distance from the CBD. At present, the property is leased to excellent tenants for $270 per week, but has the option for vacant possession if preferred.
Why wait? 11 Grace Street can be the next valuable addition to your investment portfolio or an ideal way for a first home buyer to enter the property market in a sought after suburb.","SOLD - $277,000","3

It features three good-sized bedrooms, all with robes, modernised three-piece bathroom, gas-heated living room with polished timber floors adjoining tiled kitchen and dining area. U-shaped kitchen boasts gas cooker, dishwasher, good bench space and storage including appliance cupboard.
A rear extension incorporates a great family living room with cosy solid fuel heater opening to a covered outdoor living area.

Set on a big block approx 1000m², it has a huge backyard with road at the rear lending itself to development STCA.
Well-located close to schools, Lake Weeroona and the CBD with bus past the door.
