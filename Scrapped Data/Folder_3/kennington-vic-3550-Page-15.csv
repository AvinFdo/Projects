kennington-vic-3550,12/190 St Aidans Road Kennington VIC 3550,"IMMACULATE TOWNHOUSE ON HISTORIC GROUNDS
This stunning property is located at the quiet end of a row of stylishly built beautiful townhouses, created to sit alongside the old St Aidan’s Orphanage and the grounds surrounding. Perfectly situated in easy walking distance from Strath Village, Strath Hill and Kennington Reservoir, this contemporary home is close to all amenities.
Enter through a beautifully landscaped courtyard and past the deck at the front of the home, offering views across the immaculately maintained grounds. As part of the Body Corporate, the owner would benefit from the gardens being cared for by professionals.
Walking into the home and through the entry hall, you are welcomed into the large lounge and dining space. Beautiful views from the vast picture window include the gardens and the city beyond.
An extended pantry and euro laundry is tucked neatly away in cabinetry across from kitchen and the modern kitchen enjoys granite overlay benchtops and high-end Bosch appliances including a dishwasher, gas cooktop, electric oven. Ample storage throughout the kitchen includes a neat rollaway benchtop cupboard for additional appliances.
Heading through to the rear of the house is a powder room and then a formal lounge. From the lounge, sliding plantation shutters and glass sliding doors open wide out to the rear deck and neat landscaped courtyard. Beautiful lemon trees neatly surround the artificial turf, and large slate paving lead to the timber feature wall that neatly hides access to the double garage.
The garage, with its roller door opening from the driveway at the rear, has additional storage and a clothesline.
Back indoors, from the front entrance, carpeted stairs lead you to the second storey. A skylight above the stairwell, and in the family bathroom, provides additional light and a landing at the top of the stairs serves as a small library.
Two good-sized bedrooms, both with built-in robes, look out over the back courtyard and the family bathroom is next to the separate toilet.
Finally, explore the luxurious master suite. Glass sliding doors lead out to a balcony, providing plenty of light and beautiful sunrise views over the city. A large walk-in robe with ample practical shelving and hanging space is next to the light and bright generously-sized ensuite, providing a beautiful outlook of the estate and beyond from the cathedral window.
This lovely modern home provides all the features you could require, including downlights and refrigerative ducted heating and cooling, and a stylish neutral décor allowing you to make it your own.
Feel secure and at home as a part of this high-end estate in a beautiful townhouse providing a low-maintenance, relaxing lifestyle.","SOLD - $450,000","3

kennington-vic-3550,53 Lowndes Street Kennington VIC 3550,"DELIGHTFUL OASIS IN KENNINGTON
Located in popular Kennington and walking distance to schools, shops, pubs, sporting and recreational reserves, Strath Village and Bendigo’s CBD is this beautifully presented property.
Positioned neatly on a wide allotment, the solid brick, mid-century style home has an immaculate front yard providing plenty of curb appeal. The established, low-maintenance garden provides secure access to the rear of the property of both sides of the house.
Under the house is a single garage and workshop, with off-street parking available for an additional vehicle.
Head up stairs, above the garage, to the entry and find a large tiled patio with views towards East Bendigo – the perfect place to sit with your morning coffee and watch the sun rise.
Through the front door is a large formal entry that makes use of original features such as timber flooring and decorative cornice.
To the right of the entry is a large master bedroom, with a built-in robe that provides additional storage above the main cupboard, an air conditioner and ceiling fan.
To the left, is a light and bright living room that provides an open plan design to access the dining room at the front of the property and kitchen at the rear. This light and bright space includes windows across three sides and French doors from the living room open out on to the front patio. A split system offers cooling and heating to the area, and ducted heating can also be found throughout the property.
The contemporary kitchen enjoys plenty of cupboard space, including a walk-in pantry and central island bench. With room for a double fridge along with a dishwasher, four-burner gas cooktop and electric oven, all modern conveniences have been considered.
From the kitchen is a small hallway leading back to the main hall. Off this is a linen closet and a laundry, which also features a toilet tucked away behind a private wall.
Off the main hallway is a light-filled family bathroom and two good-sized bedrooms, one with a ceiling fan, air conditioner and built-in robe, complete the layout.
The kitchen opens out to the backyard and a spacious undercover deck, complete with ceiling fan and merbau bench seating. This relaxing area overlooks the inground pool and a large palm tree – the perfect little oasis. To each side of the pool is a good-sized lawn area and established planting, each leading to the secure gates that open to the front yard.
This fantastic home is neat as a pin and, with nothing to do except move in and enjoy, its fantastic location ensures this is a property with plenty to offer.","SOLD - $397,500","3
