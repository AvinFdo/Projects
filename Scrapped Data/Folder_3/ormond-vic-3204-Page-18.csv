ormond-vic-3204,99 Leila Road Ormond VIC 3204,"Blending old and new harmoniously
While the comfortable spaciousness and the handsome decorative features of the iconic Californian Bungalow have been maintained and enhanced in this inviting home, it has also been given a modern makeover that effortlessly brings together the old and the new. Baltic pine floors, lovely ornamental ceilings and cornices, and deep skirting boards are featured in the entrance hall - a fitting introduction to a well presented and lovely home. There is a formal lounge room as well as a natural light-filled open-plan informal living room with a kitchen where stainless steel appliances (including a 5-burner gas cooktop), rangehood and splashback add an urban edge to country-style cabinetry. It's a highly successful combination. The residence has 4 well-proportioned bedrooms (3 with BIRs; 1 with an OFP) and a study, plus 2 bathrooms - the first with a period ambience; the other contemporary style. Perfect for outdoor entertaining and children's play, the attractively landscaped, private rear garden includes a sail-covered, brick-paved BBQ area. Among the extras are ducted heating, evaporative cooling, several ceiling fans, sheds, and ample off-street car parking in front of and behind a gate. Set in attractively landscaped gardens, on an allotment of approx. 688sqm, this property is in a prized leafy street, on the bus route, close to reserves, sporting venues, recreation and cosmopolitan Koornang Road shops, cafes and trains, convenient to schools and with quick access to Chadstone and to Monash University (Clayton and Caulfield).
