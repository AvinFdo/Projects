kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,19 Church Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"THE CREST HERITAGE BEAUTY & ADDED LIVING
An easy walk to school, shops, bus stops and train station and sitting on a generous landscaped corner allotment is The Crest: a stunning 1878-built period home. With the added bonus of a self-contained unit with its own driveway and entry, this incredible property truly is one of a kind.
The main house is one of Kangaroo Flats first permanent buildings and many heritage details have been lovingly retained offering character and charm. Features such as 12, timber-lined ceilings; timber mantles over original fireplaces; decorative cornice, ceiling roses and corbels; timber fretwork; picture railing; stained glass windows and generously proportioned rooms all add a sense of grandeur to this attractive home. Modern additions such as the contemporary bathroom and modern country kitchen ensure that every convenience is taken care of.
Three large bedrooms can be found at the front of the home, off the central hallway, and two feature built-in robes and ceiling fans. A formal lounge, also off the hall, showcases beautiful stain glass windows. A family bathroom, recently renovated with a double vanity; and a large and light laundry, with additional powder room, provide services for all.
At the rear of the home is a large open plan kitchen and dining room. The recently renovated kitchen sits beautifully within the walls of the grand old home offering contemporary country-style cabinetry and high-end appliances. Off the dining room is a large living room with dual aspect windows providing plenty of light.
The entire property sits on over quarter of an acre and the established cottage garden at the front of the house beautifully complements the bullnose verandah and iron lacework. At the rear, through French doors from both dining and living rooms, is a fabulous alfresco area and a pizza oven that will make outdoor dining a great experience year-round. Established trees, offering both shade and fruit, include lemon, blood orange and passionfruit, and shedding plus a double carport allows room for vehicles and tools.
The real bonus of this property is the fully self-contained cottage at the rear of the property. Featuring bedroom, bathroom, laundry, kitchen and living area, the cottage also includes air conditioning, gas heating and ceiling fan. The kitchen includes a dishwasher and brand new oven with separate grill and four-burner electric cooktop. Absolutely ideal for a granny flat, teenage retreat, home business or Airbnb, this great space also includes its own private driveway and access from the side street.
Additional features include:
Ducted evaporative cooling and heating throughout
Modern appliances in the kitchen including dishwasher and 900mm Westinghouse oven with ceramic cooktop
Secure vehicle access to the rear yard, ideal for additional storage for trailer or caravan
2kW solar panels with 3kW inverter (66c rebate until 2024)
Water tank
Garden shed x 2 (7 x 4m and 2 x 7m) plus workshop
Located on the Melbourne side of Bendigo, this grand property is just an hour and a half from the states capital, whilst also walking distance to all amenities, including the Kangaroo Flat train station. This is a fantastic opportunity for a buyer who is looking for more out of their home, yet still seeking a small piece of Bendigos outstanding heritage beauty.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"4

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,6B Archer Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"NOT JUST THE AVERAGE TOWNHOUSE
Don't judge this one till you've seen inside. What looks like a modest unit from kerbside is in fact a very spacious and modern townhouse boasting three robed bedrooms (WIR to main), a large study/home office, expansive living and dining areas and two bathrooms.
Tiled floors flow from the front entry throughout the residence including the front lounge with bay window while the sleek, galley-style kitchen is comparable to one you would expect to see in a grand family home. The central hub of the open-plan living area, it has room to prepare a banquet for a large contingent of family and friends.
A huge island bench with a gleaming black bench top is complemented by loads of white cabinetry and stunning glass splash backs with electric cooking appliances, dishwasher and large corner pantry.
If working from home is a requirement, the study is ideally located off the dining area and the whole residence is serviced by evaporative air conditioning and gas heating.
A small courtyard off the dining area is the perfect place to enjoy breakfast in the winter sun and the lock-up garage has direct access to the residence making unloading the car a breeze.
Life is too short to spend weekends fretting over domestic matters, this minimal maintenance townhouse and garden is meticulously finished and ideally located close to Lansell Square shops, bus stop etc.","SOLD - $320,000","3
