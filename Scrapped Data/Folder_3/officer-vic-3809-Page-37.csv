officer-vic-3809,41 Heathcote Grove Officer VIC 3809,"I'LL GIVE YOU $10 IF YOU CAN FIND A BETTER PRESENTED HOUSE ON THE MARKET
""LITERALLY YOU WON'T HAVE TO LIFT A FINGER""
You've heard of owners who keep their properties in perfect condition. But have you ever heard of an owner who steam-irons his bed sheets? Well the owner of 41 Heathcote Grove does - so this should give you a pretty good idea of the condition of the rest of the house.
Needless to say what you see in the pictures is exactly what you can expect when you visit this sparkling home. In the budding estate of Potter's Grove, this is as close as you're likely to get to Beaconsfield and Berwick without blowing the budget.
The property is within walking distance to schools, shops and public transport and also a few hundred metres from the estate's main parkland.
Given the low-maintenance yard, the house presents as an ideal investment and with such a family-friendly layout why would any first-home-buyer want to pass this up?
Featuring:
- Four bedrooms, master with walk-in robe and en-suite;
- Dual living areas;
- Modern kitchen with upgraded specs and walk-in pantry;
- Heating and cooling;
- Remote-controlled double car garage;
- Upgraded security system and 4.76kw solar system;
- Landscaped gardens, front and back.","SOLD - $593,000","4
