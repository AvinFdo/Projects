ormond-vic-3204,20 Wicklow Street ORMOND VIC 3204,"***UNDER OFFER*** Zoned period grace
From its impressive elevated presence set back from the road, with a wide frontage, to its pride of place in the McKinnon College Zone, this character laden Californian Bungalow retains all the warmth and rich detailing synonymous with its origins from double entry glass etched doors to finished timber door frames and high ornate ceilings. Stepping beyond its lovely front decked porch, you'll find a grand formal living space (tiled open fire place & a lavish leadlight bay window) opening into adjoining dining with a gas log fire complemented by original Baltic pine flooring. While enjoying early 19th century origins, it has been updated for the modern family offering four bedroom accommodation & a central timber kitchen flowing into casual entertaining which opens onto a spacious undercover alfresco deck via bi-folding doors. All of this is set in a lovely established garden, in a peaceful street with low traffic flow within strolling distance of shops, station, quality parks, public transport & further enhanced by ducted gas heating, RC air conditioning, period style bathroom, ample off street parking, garden shed, second shower, separate WC & laundry.
