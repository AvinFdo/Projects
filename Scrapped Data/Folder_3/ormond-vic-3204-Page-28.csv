ormond-vic-3204,2/234 Booran Road ORMOND VIC 3204,"Villa Living Should Always Be This Good!
Here's a villa that's you'll want to call your own. It's peacefully set at the rear of two homes on the block and offers all the comforts and considerations we expect today, plus quite a bit more. It has been renovated with confidence to include a neutral decor with bold highlights to add edginess to the interior design. Leading the way is the open plan living room where the kitchen elicits a big tick of approval. Glossy tomato red glass splashback and cabinetry (soft close drawers and doors) is offset by appliances faced in black glass, and by the white composite stone benchtops. Two of the 3 bedrooms have attractive translucent glass on the BIRs, and both chic bathrooms are fully tiled. A private wraparound courtyard has a north-facing covered deck. Security alarm, ducted heating and cooling, ducted vacuum, and direct entry to the house from the double garage are among the inclusions. Catch the bus from directly outside; the route goes from Elsternwick to Chadstone Shopping Centre and points in between. Reserves and recreation are nearby, major access roads are handy; Monash Uni (Caulfield campus) is not far and all other amenities are in convenient distance.

ormond-vic-3204,36 Anthony Street ORMOND VIC 3204,"Rosewood"" c. 1927 Grand Brick Californian on Large Land
One of the grandest period homes on this grand in-Zone period streetscape, Rosewood c.1927 is a late Californian Bungalow of spectacular scale and superb Art Deco influences. Extended from a solid-brick base with a four bedroom, two bathroom floorplan the home cleverly uses a wide triple-fronted design across a sweeping 60'/18.29m frontage to offer gracious living in bow-bay-windowed lounge and dining rooms - while an elegant master suite (with ensuite and WIR), a rear kids' wing and an expansive family zone offer the best of modern family life.
With spectacular fireplaces, lavish leadlight and elaborately decorated ceilings pointing to the home's history as a residence of significance, the home is also significantly well-renovated for today's living with an elite appliance and granite kitchen overlooking the family zone, quality bathrooms, ducted heating and cooling.
Even the grounds offer a superior blend of beauty and amenity with a through-access oversized double garage (with workshop and through access to boat or trailer parking) set in around 8520sqft/791sqm rose-filled hedged formal surrounds. Situated close to Ormond's shopping and transport strip just minutes' walk to McKinnon College, this is a grand Californian on great land.","SOLD - $1,465,000","4
