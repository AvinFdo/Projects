kennington-vic-3550,54 Stoney Gum Lane Lockwood VIC 3551,"House, Self Contained Unit & 3 Sheds on 3.5Ac
It's always a pleasure to return to a property to see what past clients have created once they have renovated and put their stamp on a place. To say that what I saw when I recently returned to 54 Stoney Gum Lane was ""pleasing"" would be a total understatement. The place is utterly transformed! How lucky the property was to land in the hands of a skilled carpenter when it was last sold. It's only that a job opportunity interstate has arisen, that this family will part with the property so soon after the completion of the renovation works.
This provides you with an opportunity to secure this beautiful 3.5 acre property and enviable country lifestyle. Here you'll enjoy the convenience of being located just as short 5 minute drive to Kangaroo Flat and 10 minutes to central Bendigo. As well as the privacy, serenity and health and wellness benefits of this perfect position, adjacent to the Lockwood South State Forest.
The house has been redesigned to maximise enjoyment of the stunning natural environment here. For example the new stacking doors to the lounge and open plan dining area lets in birdsong, sunlight and warmth, refreshing breezes and leafy green views as you desire. The three bedrooms are generously big and there is now an abundance of storage with brilliant cabinetry in the laundry, fitted robes to bedroom two and three and a walk in robe to the main. While the kitchen provides a walk in pantry and heaps of clever cabinetry. The parquetry floor in the kitchen was a labour of love for the carpenter owner. The front north facing deck and rear verandah dress and finish the home perfectly. The modern neutral decor, brand new carpets, paint, window furnishings and lighting all emphasise the perfect homely feel here.
Extensive shedding includes a 6 x 9m shed, a 5.5 x 7m workshop with a 3 x 7m carport and a 3 x 5.5m storage shed.
Your young adult will love the self contained unit - though may never want to move out of home! It's very, very cool! With keypad entry, marble look tile floor, skylight and LED lighting, lounge area, kitchenette and bedroom space it's truly a home in itself! What appear to be extensive robes near the bed in fact are. Oh, except for the middle doors which lead into a private ensuite!
