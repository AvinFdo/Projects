kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,15 O'Dea Crescent Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"A FABULOUS INVESTMENT CURRENTLY TENANTED!
Located only a few minutes from all the amenities of Kangaroo Flat including supermarkets and schools, this flexible property is positioned in a quiet street with a bus stop just around the corner. A neat established garden at the front of the property includes a wide driveway to a double carport, which allows for plenty of off-street parking.
The main property is a solid brick, three-bedroom home. All bedrooms have built-in robes and the master enjoys a ceiling fan and neat ensuite. The main living space is directly off the front entry, and its L-shape ensures the room has plenty of natural light and allows for flexibility of use. The kitchen and dining room is accessible via the living room and the main hallway and also off the hall is a family bathroom, linen closet, separate toilet and a door to the side of the house.
Outdoors, the side of the main house includes an enclosed fernery and out the back is a large lawn area, a fantastic undercover alfresco space ideal for outdoor meals, and shedding.
Also on the allotment is a separate, fully self-contained unit. This great little flat offers a private entrance leading up a ramp to the front door. Indoors is an open plan lounge, kitchen and dining room with great storage. A single bedroom features a walk-in robe and the bathroom includes a large shower. The unit has access to the main garden, but also enjoys a private garden and water tank on the other side.
Additional features include:
Ducted evaporative cooling and heating in main house
Four-burner gas cooktop, electric oven and dishwasher
Access from both sides of the property into the rear garden
Spacious backyard
Single garage and work shed in backyard
Water tank x 2
Separate fully self-contained unit
With two practical properties on the one allotment, this is a fantastic investment opportunity, particularly given that currently the two homes service satisfied, quality tenants on a periodic lease with a return of $430 per week combined rent. Located in a quiet street yet still close to the highway and amenities of Kangaroo Flat, the property is also walking distance to medical practitioners and within easy access of bus stops.","SOLD - $347,500","4

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,198 Mackenzie Street West Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Affordable family home
This classic brick home is a real surprise package, and ready for some cosmetic updates to create a comfortable family home.
With 5 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms between the main house and studio, this home is ideal for investors or dual-occupancy combinations.
The residence contains a large kitchen-meals area with gas cooktop and wall oven, benchtop and cupboards aplenty, plus space for a wide fridge and sideboard.
The lounge with wood heater is in a separate adjoining room, and a split-system keeps both zones conveniently climate controlled.
The main bedroom has an ensuite as well as a walk-in robe.
Beyond the back door, a wide lengthy patio is ready for barbies, and the fantastic 2 bedroom studio with open plan living offers excellent accommodation standards. Furthermore, the fully-fenced 833m2 block encompasses garden sheds, shade trees, carport and extra off-street parking.
Being only about 150 metres from a bushland reserve and vast park with playground, is an instant attraction.
So too is the 5 minute bike ride to schools and college, less to sports and leisure centres.
It's just a 12 minute stroll to medical services, or you can catch a bus from just a few doors away.
An excellent choice for a wide range of buyers!","SOLD - $330,000","3
