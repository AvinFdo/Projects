essendon-vic-3040,1 Agatha Street Essendon VIC 3040,"Prestigious position and opportunity
It's rare to chance across a loved family entertainer with good bones to reinvent, rent out or redevelop (STCA) on a wide street frontage in such a prestigious and tranquil position with no drive through traffic. Built with family values, dimensions and entertainers flow to grow and cook up your own produce with a rear food prep room to make the family pastas, relishes and then toast and taste to old fashioned traditions. Alternately with minor adjustments, repurpose this rear room with its own sink and toilet as a granny flat, studio, gym or games room. Originally a timber Victorian, this elevated brick home is immediately comfortable with three generous bedrooms with good quality carpets and some with BIR's. There's a hard wearing tiled hallway, lounge and kitchen with some period details still visible. A sturdy kitchen and large pantry serve to an open plan design, with hydronic heating throughout, a separate toilet, shower, laundry and bathroom complete with second shower and a bath. Entertaining flows easily through the sliding doors to the rear garden, with a true hills hoist clothes line, rear accessed garage with workshop, central tiled and tiered fernery, separate toilet and room with a sink or studio. There's room for alfresco dining, kids play, off-street parking for several cars and living in comfort while you remodel and repurpose. An exceptional quiet street only a stroll to one of Melbourne's most successful primary & high schools, Pascoe Vale Rd, Mt Alexander Rd trendy cafes, Windy Hill, Essendon Cricket Ground, Essendon Train, trams, buses, medical facilities, airports and freeways.","SOLD - $1,455,000","3
