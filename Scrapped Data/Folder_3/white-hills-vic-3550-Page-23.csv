white-hills-vic-3550,31 - 39 Church Street WHITE HILLS VIC 3550,"HILLTOP HOUSE
Where else could you live within 6 minutes of the Bendigo CBD, but still keep your horse and retain the rural lifestyle. Living in this immaculately presented 5 bedroom home would be one of the easiest things to do.
Perched high up on the elevated allotment of approx. 4 acres, there is sufficient room both inside and outside for the whole family to love. It wouldn't be difficult to say that you had your own “mansion” of approx. 40 squares incorporating 3 bedrooms downstairs and two bedrooms upstairs with separate living zones on each level. Whether you want to entertain in the formal lounge and dining area on the ground floor whilst other family members entertain guests in the billiard room, family room or extensive concrete entertaining deck, the possibilities for parties are endless.
The fresh and modern well-appointed kitchen looks out to the spa and rear yard and also adjoins the formal dining room.
Opportunities for outdoor play exist with a floodlit “mod grass” tennis court, cricket pitch, putting green, basketball area and paddock to keep your horse or pony. Picturesque views over both the dam (2.3 meg water right) and rear yard are a sight to be seen. An impressive large workshop of 40 x 25 x 10 with power and concrete floor will make the handyman or tradie envious. Town water, natural gas, auto watering system plus a host of other features ensure an inspection will not disappoint.
