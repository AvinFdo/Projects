The property has two bedrooms, lounge with open fireplace, and spacious open-plan kitchen/dining room with gas plates, electric wall oven and solid fuel heater.
Laundry and bathroom with claw foot bath and vanity.
Outside is a paved brick pergola area, cottage gardens, and shed with 2 car parking spaces and a workshop area. There is a standalone studio which is a great space for your hobbies, 1.5kw solar system, plus tank water for the Cottage and a 1 meg water entitlement that feeds directly into the dam.
This is a fantastic location on the edge of the forest and at the end of the lane, with wildlife and bird life around, and just three minutes to Kangaroo Flat.
This unique Cottage has lots of history, and is well worth inspecting.","SOLD - $343,000","2

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,1 Odea Crescent Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"A GREAT CHOICE IN KANGAROO FLAT
This is an excellent example of a home that has been really well looked after inside and out over many years. It offers two living spaces, easy-care yard and position is superb - a walk to the shops and schools, only metres from transport and miles of walking tracks along Bendigo Creek and handy to Crusoe Reservoir.
Inside this neat and tidy home there is a large L-shaped lounge and dining room boasting modern floating floor, split-system heating and cooling and a gas wall furnace; there's a separate meals space and smaller family room which has access outside. The kitchen is adjacent and boasts gas hot plates, electric oven, ample cabinetry and overhead cupboards and there are views to the rear yard.
All three bedrooms are spacious and feature built-in-robes, the bathroom boasts a corner shower and large vanity unit and there's a separate toilet. The laundry is tiled, has a cupboard and has handy access out back.
Out front is a long veranda facing north-west with sunblinds for that afternoon sun protection, at the rear is a large covered alfresco spanning the length of the house. There's a garden bed dividing the alfresco from the single carport and single car space - which boasts an auto roller-door with direct street access from Queen St.
The 534m2 allotment is private, there is a grassed space in the rear yard, a small garden shed and everything is simply neat, tidy and there is nothing to do.
This home is very attractive from the front with the lovely feature palms on display, it is easy-care and ripe for the new owner to continue on the legacy of this lovely home.","SOLD - $335,000","3
