The beauty of possessing an address in the Royal Botanic Gardens precinct is perfectly expressed by this refined residence over two floors, a property where superb indoor proportions are matched by inviting outdoor dimensions including a majestic roof-top terrace featuring a swimming pool and fabulous city views. Memorably updated and enhanced under the assured guidance of Stuart Rattle, the design delivers separate formal and informal living and dining domains, each accompanied by private courtyard that provide perfect retreats for entertaining in style or simply enjoying a sense of escape. An open-plan kitchen complemented by oak flooring, stone surfaces, a central island and a walk-in pantry caters to any occasion with efficiency and elegance while a versatile study adds to the downstairs attraction. Upstairs, balcony aspects and terrace access enhance the luxury of a main bedroom featuring a generous walk-in robe and a substantial spa bath ensuite. Two further bedrooms, both with built-in robes, share an impressively appointed main bathroom that confirms the quality of the accommodation. The pool's paved surroundings and the sights of the city take the allure to the next level, creating a sensational conclusion to a home offering the consummate convenience of double garage and additional off street parking for two. Leading schools, Domain Road cafes, the 'tan' track, Fawkner Park, the Yarra and Toorak Road ensure there are attractions in literally every direction - What a great location!",SOLD - Price Withheld,"4
