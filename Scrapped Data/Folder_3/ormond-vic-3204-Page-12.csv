ormond-vic-3204,15 Newham Grove Ormond VIC 3204,"Como - the Past, the Present, the Future
Much more than an elegant period home that has been extended and modernised, these days Como is an exceptional family home with a focus on energy efficiency, thoughtful extras that enhance the quality of life, and many cost-cutting measures in place.
Delightful period features remain and have been enhanced with the addition of, for example, superb messmate timber flooring and with the ornamental ceilings in the front rooms being carried through to the modern extension. Stained timber architraves and skirting boards and a wide, timber panelled entrance hall, etched glass internal doors and attractive leadlighting are enhanced by LED lighting throughout, and double glazed windows.
A formal dining room/music room/open study (you decide) with open fireplace flows into the sun-drenched living room (A/C) where the kitchen has heaps of bench space and storage. Large glass doors open to a huge, partly covered deck (with built-in bench seating), a fabulous entertaining area overlooking the private garden with an extra-high acoustic fence. Let the party flow from inside to outside!
There are 3 plus-size bedrooms (master bedroom with OFP, fitted WIR and ensuite) and a family bathroom with dual access. Check out the hideaway entry in the walk-in wardrobe - it leads upstairs to an attic office!
How about an electricity bill that has been a total of $42 during the past 8 years? This incredible saving is thanks to the solar panels (2.5KW) here. Two rainwater tanks supply water to the toilets and laundry. And a terrific veggie patch with raised garden beds and a number of fruit trees can make a family self-sufficient.
Ducted gas heating and an alarm are included along with copious off-street parking and a double garage. Land size is approx 726sqm.
As for the location - it is a 5-minute walk to the new Ormond station (and Ormond Village shops and cafes), and a 20 minute train ride to the CBD. Buses, schools including Kilvington, reserves and recreation are all nearby, too. It is a great location!","SOLD - $1,497,500","3
