kennington-vic-3550,8 Yallambee Drive Kennington VIC 3550,"MID-CENTURY MODERN MASTERPIECE
Tucked away in a quiet street in the coveted McIvor Hill locale handy to schools, supermarket, transport and sporting facilities, this property is the perfect package of position, personality and mid-century modern panache.
Understated from the street but with lots of interior style, it was designed by highly regarded architects, Whitford and Peck in the late 60's. A far cry from the more traditional brown brick veneer homes of the era, it exhibits modernist style features such as clean, simple lines with no excess detailing, floor to ceiling windows, polished timber floors and a relaxed indoor outdoor aesthetic.nOne of the most striking features is the use of natural light throughout, with every room overlooking gardens, courtyards or patios.
An ideal home for entertaining, it has spacious lounge and dining rooms with a separate sitting room or library with a wall of bookshelves and open fireplace creating the perfect space for coffee or a port after dinner.
A new galley-style kitchen boasts the best in appliances and walk-in pantry with a dinette at the end and sliding doors to a relaxing courtyard with light-filtering wisteria vine overhead and a stacked stone wall for privacy.
Internal temperature control is taken care of by new gas ducted heating and split system units.
All three bedrooms feature extensive fitted robes while the large master suite is located away from the action and overlooks the rear patio while all-new bathroom includes bath, walk-in shower and vanity with a new laundry and second WC alongside.
Storage space is premium throughout; linen cupboards line the hallway and a brick-lined under-house store room makes the perfect wine cellar to keep the reds in mint condition for that special dinner party while hiding bulky items like suitcases and sports gear.
The landscaped allotment approximately 1,136 m² is like a private sanctuary where brick paths wind between stone edged-garden beds under shady trees with room for a pool if desired.
This unique home is solid, immaculately presented and retains its ""in vogue"" mid-century modern styling","SOLD - $780,000","3

kennington-vic-3550,4 George Street Kennington VIC 3550,"Charm & Character In The Ever Popular Kennington
You'll love the location of this charming California Bungalow home - a short walk to the centre of town and 100 metres from Kennington Recreation Reserve and the Harry Trott Oval. Popular schools - St Therese's, Kennington Primary and Bendigo South East - are close by. Beautiful stained glass windows, polished hardwood floors and ceiling roses in the bedrooms are just some of the original features of this much loved home. The well designed kitchen would suit the keen cook, with Miele appliances and ample storage, including a walk in pantry. The dining area and living space have sliding double glazed floor to ceiling windows which open out to a vine covered deck overlooking the garden.
The large backyard has established fruit trees and two water tanks. There is a garage and another fully lined shed. This is a home you can just move into and enjoy but there's also scope for the new owners to add their own personal touches or even to expand the house.","SOLD - $365,000","3

The L shaped central hallway with linen press leads to the property’s two remaining double bedrooms as well as the recently renovated crisp white and timber laundry and stunning matching bathroom with high gloss cabinetry, shower, toilet, free standing oval bath and vanity with round above mount hand basin, round mirror and striking black fixtures and fittings. The largest of these bedrooms includes a complete wall of elegant floor to ceiling black cabinetry and walk in storage in the third.

A stones throw from La Trobe University and other major amenities including Kennington & Strath Village shopping complexes, and the popular Kennington Lake, this property will suit a range of quality home seekers including families, retirees and investors alike!

The floor plan is flexible and spacious, and remains in superb condition with some recent renovations a bonus for the new owner. Boasting four good sized bedrooms, all with built in robes and the master suite featuring walk in robe and ensuite. The main bathroom and laundry are located in the rear wing of the home, whilst a separate study (or fifth bedroom) lies off the entrance at the front. Attractive timber floors flow through most of the home, whilst ducted cooling and gas heating take care of the temperature. Ticking an important box are the two separate living spaces – the first is the spacious lounge with feature brick wall and gas log fire, the second forming part of the open plan kitchen meals and living area. The brand new modern kitchen is a gift to the lucky purchaser, and includes new 900mm oven and cooktop, dishwasher and all new cabinetry and benches as well as walk in pantry and lovely breakfast bar.
Outside, the sizable 1180m2 (approx.) allotment has been beautifully landscaped with lovely gardens, lawn and paths meaning most of the hard work has been done for you. If you enjoy dining or entertaining outdoors, the enormous covered entertaining area will absolutely delight! With a built in bbq and enough room for a large gathering in any weather, it will also double as an extra carport for a caravan or trailer! A double garage lies at the front, with plenty of room for off street caravan storage as well. A clever conversion of an concrete water tank takes care of shedding.
An absolute gem that is ready to live in and love immediately, with vacant possession available now. In a top position in a terrific neighbourhood, come and see for yourself and you will be suitably impressed!","SOLD - $485,000","4
