keilor-vic-3036,10 Hopkins Avenue Keilor VIC 3036,"When Presentation & Location Matter!
This immaculate family home, tightly held by current owners for decades, offers well-located, low maintenance living in a blue-ribbon location and with quick easy access to local amenities, including walking distance to the Keilor Village local shops and cafes.
A classic brick and tile, circa early 1980's; the home exudes great charm and warmth, and is complete with elegant entry porch and foyer, three bedrooms, study/4th bedroom, two bathrooms, formal lounge/dining, casual living/meals, stylish updated kitchen, separate laundry, triple covered carparking plus extra room onsite, and a private covered deck for alfresco entertaining.
Meticulously cared for by its long-term owners, presentation shines and features include: quality window furnishings, stone benches in kitchen, stainless steel appliances, gas cooktop, ducted heating, evaporative cooling, timber-look vinyl flooring in casual living/kitchen/study, separate bath and shower in main bathroom, exposed aggregate driveway, and easy-care landscaped gardens.
A timeless design, there is a welcoming, cosy ambience throughout, almost a sense of familiarity; it's a lovely place to hang your hat and stay for a while...you'll see why existing owners have anchored down here for so long; it is simply delightful, and so very liveable.
Your entertaining needs can be catered for inside or out on the pergola; from formal dinners through to casual weekend BBQ's, you can accommodate your guests in impeccable style and comfort.
The deck would make the perfect spot for Christmas lunch...and your 'go to' place for your morning coffee or twilight sun-downers at 'wine o'clock'.
Inside and out, there is no immediate money to be spent; the living is easy, and the location is sought-after - with premium schools to choose from, wonderful parks in the local vicinity, and 18 kilometres to the CBD, you can embrace the quiet life without sacrificing convenience.
