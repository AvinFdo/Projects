ormond-vic-3204,15 Blackshaw Street Ormond VIC 3204,"Hampton's Style Home in the College Zone
Cutting edge, College Zoned and intuitively crafted for the modern family, this is indoor-outdoor opulence in Ormond's best address.
Built to the demanding specifications by an award-winning home designer, this 4-bedroom, 2-bathroom home comes with classic Hampton's interior styling, three distinct living zones and every conceivable luxury over an expansive single level.
Designed with a strong emphasis on family living, the home goes beyond its timeless Rhode Island faÃ§ade with a place to relax in a formal sitting area, room to lounge and dine in a widespread open plan and space to retreat in a private home theatre.
A showcase of cutting edge detail from Porcelain Woodline tiled floors and stone benchtops, to soft closing cabinets with custom-fitted drawers, the home sees a butler's pantry extend to additional walk-in shelving in the prestige Blanco kitchen, a luxe dual vanity ensuite for the private master domain and a kid's bedroom wing with its own luxurious bathroom.
But it's not just the interior that sets this home apart. Set in low maintenance, north facing rear gardens, there's lawn space for kids to play, a wide stretch of blackbutt decking to entertain plus a fan-cooled al fresco pavilion beyond two sets of seamless sliding stacker doors.
Featuring a network of roof storage above 2.9m ceilings, double glazing and a dedicated study nook, this contemporary residence works hard too - with 5-star high efficiency ducted heating, refrigerated cooling for climate control, auto irrigation for the gardens, external blinds and a remote electric front gate to a big double garage.
Best of all, this 575sqm approx. property has Ormond's best in-zone position, with McKinnon College, Reserve, Village and transformed railway within a walk, Centre Rd's cosmopolitan shopping and dining destinations within minutes and an easy commute to GESAC, Southland and Chadstone.
