Another successful marketing campaign by Team Newbond at Woodards Carnegie - considering selling call Cedric 0418 326 174 or Maria 0407 359 676 for exceptional service:
Architect-designed, master craftsmen-built and with an interior conceived by an award winning designer, this beautiful modern home is a reflection of the skill, love and care lavished upon it. It is the front of 2 on the block, with a real sense of privacy and peacefulness. Gleaming hardwood flooring and extensive glazing enhanced by superb presentation and an open, spacious, fresh, natural light-drenched interior make this residence shine. The L-shape lounge-dining room has door out to a deck and the pretty front garden. A chic kitchen (with Asko appliances) is open to the family room, leading to a private decked area. The master bedroom (WIR; shared access to a bathroom) is on the ground floor, zoned apart from 3 upstairs bedrooms (BIRs) which have pitched ceilings and are serviced by a large bathroom. Ducted heating and a double garage (automatic door) are among the inclusions. This prestigious property is in a prime pocket of Ormond with convenient access to the best Ormond, Carnegie and Glen Huntly offer.
