The rear yard includes garden shed, easy-care garden beds, rainwater tank and a side paved area with twin gazebos â?? one with a portable spa.
The double garage has auto-lift door, direct access to the living room and the rear yard plus some workshop space for those who like to tinker.
But there's more â?? all-important side access for boat/caravan/trailer or visitor parking.

There are ten solar panels on the roof and an inverter in the garage that has fed enough power back into the grid to have kept mum in credit with the electricity company for the last four years with the last bill being some $2700 in credit.","SOLD - $432,500","3
