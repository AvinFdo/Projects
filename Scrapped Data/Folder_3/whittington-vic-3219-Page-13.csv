whittington-vic-3219,178 Wilsons Road Whittington VIC 3219,"4 Bedroom home without the price tag!
Spruce up or simply move in and relax, either way this home has so much to offer. Step inside and be surprised. Kitchen with long breakfast bar, 2 living areas and 4 bedrooms with built-in robes, it certainly is larger than it looks from the street. A gas stove plus gas heating are employed for ease and efficiency. An extra-large single garage means potential workshop space and the attached covered storage area could shelter your trailer. The fully fenced big backyard can safely contain pets and children at play. Central to so many facilities, there's little need for a car living here. Cycle into the CBD in 12 minutes or 6 driving, be bayside in 8 minutes by car or 15 by bike and the same to the closest train station for commuters. Stroll to choice of 2 primary schools, secondary college and the Gordon. Meander down to Bellarine Village shopping centre in under 10 minutes, and the Mill Market in less for a pleasant Sunday afternoon. Current rental return $300p.w. Both investors and home seekers should see this one!
