white-hills-vic-3550,532 Napier Street White Hills VIC 3550,"A Truly Unique Property. Historically Significant. Dual Occupancy
A grand old lady has been reborn,
A truly unique property full of history & the bonus of dual occupancy. The Former ""White Hills Reading Rooms"" has been sympathetically transformed into a character filled 3 or 4 bedroom home that oozes history, ambiance & a true sense of self.
The intrigue of this property is satiated the moment you step into the front entrance hall with double doors that usher you through to the large separate Billiards Room with most original features retained including timber wall paneling & ceilings, floorboards & open fire place. This room can be kept quite separate from the main part of the residence lending itself perfectly to a professional home office situation. Passing through the central hallway you enter the former Main Hall, this very large room has the WOW factor & is now a feature kitchen/dining lounge living area of grand proportions with the significant & notable 22' timber lined mansard ceilings as well as leadlight doors & jarrah floors. Inclusive of the custom designed 2Pac kitchen with its amazing butlers pantry with many quirky features.
There are further additional large storage rooms tucked discreetly at the rear of the residence. Most useful & with scope for alternative use. The central bathroom features
an original French porcelain transfer basin & accessories, shower & toilet.

Original features are self evident & in abundance through out this historically significant property that has itself permanently positioned in the historic fabric of Bendigo & White Hills. But the icing on the cake & a very big bonus here
is the totally self contained solid brick 2nd Residence on this property. Comprising 2 bedrooms, Kitchen dining lounge room, bathroom ,Sep. toilet,laundry & carport.
