kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,2 Myrnong Court Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"A CHARMING SLICE OF BENDIGOS HISTORY
This unique and beautifully presented home is an absolutely charming piece of Bendigos gold mining heritage. Built in 1857 by Englishman, John Cappy, the home offers a blend of Colonial picturesque architecture and Gothic-influenced detailing. Described, in an 1872 edition of the Bendigo Advertiser as an English gentlemans home the property retains many of the original details that made it so.
Positioned high at the top of a quiet court, the cottage garden leads up to the pretty, historical façade. A wide verandah flanks the front of the home, and the main entry is spacious, light-filled and packed full of stunning original features. The master bedroom, off the main entry, is generously proportioned with fantastic built-in storage; a large bay window with oversized sash windows and an ensuite with bath neatly hidden away. A second bedroom behind the master, also offers fantastic proportions, including built-in robes, and a third bedroom can be found on the other side of the home.
Also off the main entry is the first of two large living areas. This beautiful room includes timber-lined ceilings and original marble fireplace. Next door, a second living room also offers space for formal dining and features a large bay window. Behind this room is the country style kitchen and diner with ample storage and period detailing such as pressed metal splashback. Pressed metal lining on the cabinetry offers further character and charm to the space.
A hallway running along the rear of the property leads off to a study with built-in shelving, and the floorplan is completed with a bathroom and a good-sized laundry. Skylights in the hallway and main bathroom allow plenty of natural light into the space.
Doors from the house open out to a large paved brick alfresco area. An established garden surrounds a lawn area, and a separate lawn and garden offers a lush backdrop to the fully fenced inground pool. A driveway at the side of the house leads around to a double carport and provides additional off-street parking. Further garden space to the side of the home, and a workshop ensures there is plenty of room to keep any green thumb happy.
Additional features include:
Ducted heating throughout
Gas heating and wood fireplace in living areas
Ceiling fans throughout
Original heritage features throughout including high ceilings, large rooms, decorative cornice and ceiling roses, timber flooring, dado boards and marble fireplaces

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,3A Keast Court Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Unique Home in Quiet Court Location
Ten years young yet an absolute charmer, this architecturally-designed abode totally owns authentic uniqueness. From stone exterior quarried locally in Castlemaine to split-level floorplan culminating in spectacular city-scape vistas, it's flush with natural light, character features and comforts.
Set amongst deliriously healthy date palms in stunning landscaped grounds, it seems like this superbly finished property was established 150 years ago! French doors grant easy access to a broad verandah, covered alfresco and private courtyard for their full appreciation.
Vast enough for several sofas, the living zone looks none-the-less incredibly cosy. You'll be wishing for cool weather this year, just so the family can cuddle up around the gas log fire! But a split system, ducted gas heating and ceiling fans have all bases covered anyway. Genuine hardwood floors and LED lighting are more outstanding inclusions, as well as modern appliances in a perfectly appointed and utterly gorgeous kitchen.
Upon the entry level, 2 large bedrooms share a bathroom and separate toilet. Upstairs, the retreat or 3rd bedroom has an ensuite and desk, along with 3 dormer windows to admire the sensational views.
Nearby, Cooinda Park provides a pleasant place for family fun, plus there's a gym just a warm-up jog away. Ride to school and college in 5 minutes, drive into the city centre in 10 or bus in about 25. Closer still is a train station plus shopping precinct possessing all you need and a major complex a little further up the road, en route to Melbourne.

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,1/204 Aspinall Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"More like a house than a unit.
This is no ordinary unit, it's more like the first home you have before you're ready for a first home or the downsizer before you're ready for a downsizer.
Sited at the rear of an elevated block, it offers more garden area than normal along with added levels of privacy and security.
Bigger and brighter internally than most units, it has been lavished with love and attention by the current owners who have totally refreshed and upgraded it with bathroom fittings, floor coverings, drapes, paintwork, wardrobe and security doors.
It has two good-sized bedrooms, both with mirrored-fronted robes, convenient two-way bathroom beside the oversized main bedroom, spacious lounge with study nook overlooking the front garden, u-shaped kitchen with gas cooking and ample cabinetry adjoining a roomy dining area and laundry
with external access.
Split air conditioning system in the lounge and gas heating in the dining area ensures no-one is left out in the cold.
Low-maintenance rear yard, accessed through the double carport or sliding doors from the dining area, is a low-maintenance, paved courtyard-style with a vine-draped backdrop behind bluestone retaining walls with plenty of room for entertaining family and friends on lazy summer evenings while a brick storage room at the end of the carport secures garden tools, bikes etc.
Ideally located close to public transport, it's a great stepping-stone home and as good as the day it was built.","SOLD - $278,000","2
