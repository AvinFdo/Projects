whittington-vic-3219,11 Charlotte Avenue Newcomb VIC 3219,"Amazing Value - ""price not to be missed""
The owner has now reduced the price to $345,000 - $365,000 and is keen to sell the property now. Don't miss this great value home in the best part of Newcomb.
Welcome to this beautiful three bedroom, study, one bathroom, home, located on the corner of Charlotte Avenue and Johnston Avenue sitting on a block size of 383m2 (approx.). This would be perfect for a first home buyer or for someone looking to downsize as the property has very low maintenance. This smart block still has an amazing sense of space with the lounge, dining & kitchen all coming together to create an open floor living, with a large window in the kitchen bringing in large amounts of northern sunlight throughout the day.
As you step out your front door only 100 meters down the road and you will find yourself at Woolworths front doors, just a six-minute drive to Geelong CBD, this location is great right in the middle of everything but still yet in a quiet area of super popular Newcomb.
Also featuring gas heater, split system in lounge room, lovely private courtyard with pergola and also offers off street parking.
Rental estimate $350 p/w available for vacant possession now.","SOLD - $330,000","3
