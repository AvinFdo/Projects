essendon-vic-3040,126 Market Street Essendon VIC 3040,"Sensational New Style!
Just completed and ready to be enjoyed, this freestanding residence affords an exceptional lifestyle of low-maintenance luxury thanks to its spacious floorplan, first-class features throughout and enviable Essendon convenience - all on its own separately-titled block with no shared land. High square-set ceilings across both levels, the home's vogue interior showcases three generous bedrooms (large master with fitted WIR and balcony with views), luxurious ensuite and equally-stylish main bathroom - both with freestanding tubs and floor-to-ceiling tiles. Bathed in natural light, the open-plan living/dining area is further enhanced by a tastefully-appointed kitchen complete with mirrored splashbacks, ample cupboard space and premium Smeg appliances. Zoned ducted heating/refrigerated cooling, solid hardwood floors and double-glazed windows all add to the appeal, along with an alarm system, video intercom, soft-close cabinetry and stone benchtops throughout, large laundry with plenty of storage and guest powder room (third WC). Stacker doors reveal a sunny wrap-around courtyard with extensive decking, plus the added advantage of a remote-control double garage with internal entry. Walking distance to Keilor Road trams, eateries and renowned retail precinct, it's also close to the open spaces of Buckley Park, Essendon North Primary School and Buckley Park College (zoned to both), as well as easy access to Citylink.","SOLD - $1,050,000","3
