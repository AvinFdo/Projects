Worthy of a master chef, the centrepiece culinary kitchen is unlike anything you have seen before with a Pitt cooktop where the burners seemingly float above the Porcelain benchtops, an induction cooktop, two ovens, two sinks, two European dishwashers, an extra-large integrated fridge and freezer and a waterfall-edge central island/breakfast bar to display your gourmet feasts.
