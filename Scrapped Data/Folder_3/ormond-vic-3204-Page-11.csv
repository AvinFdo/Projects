ormond-vic-3204,1/13 Ulupna Road Ormond VIC 3204,"The Definition of a Garden Apartment
Standing out proudly from its peers thanks to a simply huge alfresco terrace, this renovated two-bedroom apartment is one out of the box! Metres from Ormond's restaurant and cafe scene, and just moments from the station, head out to enjoy what's on offer then escape to your exclusive garden retreat.
Boasting a ground floor position at the front of the well-maintained group, the apartment has been polished and refined to provide a contemporary setting. Warm floors and crisp walls feature in the combined living and dining room which leads to a stylish stone kitchen showcasing not only an induction cooktop and Bosch oven, but also a quality stainless steel dishwasher.
But the real attraction is found outside, spilling from the master bedroom, the vast private courtyard more than doubles the space to enjoy and sets the scene for sunny relaxation or the largest alfresco gatherings - it wraps around the home to a convenient washing line and storage shed.
Both of the generous double bedrooms include the benefit of fitted wardrobes and share a sleekly finished bathroom, whilst split system heating/cooling plus allocated parking and secure entry clinch a fabulous deal.","SOLD - $534,000","2

ormond-vic-3204,37 Malane Street Ormond VIC 3204,"A Prime Opportunity in an Iconic Street
Here is a special property in iconic Malane Street, which is lined by charming homes from the Californian Bungalow era. To maintain the period integrity of the streetscape, a heritage overlay has been attached to the facades of the residences, making this a truly delightful enclave and a highly desirable residential area.
There is no doubt that the next owners of this property will want to modernise and perhaps extend the weary old 3-bedroom home that has obviously done sterling service. Apart from that innately warm ambience found in homes of this era - and also high ceilings, well proportioned rooms, and a noteworthy pair of leadlight windows in one of the two living rooms - not many period features remain here. Yet there is so much promise! It is easy to imagine the very essence of the era restored to the front rooms of the home and then a modern addition bringing today's comforts into play. Then again, a sleek contemporary abode hiding behind a period façade could be the way to go. Whatever the decision for the future of this residence, it is a win-win situation.
The home - occupying a prime allotment (approx. 670sqm) with the bonus of rear access to Fraser Street - is located with EE Gunn Reserve at one end of the street and nearby shops, cafes, trains, buses, schools and recreation.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"3
