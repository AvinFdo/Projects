If you have viewed the virtual tour and are in a position to buy the property broadly within the indicated price, please call 9379 5616 to arrange a private viewing.
When your booking is confirmed, we'll greet you at the property with a smile (hidden behind our mask) instead of a handshake, then it's business as usual!

***PLEASE NOTE*** Due to Victorian Government restrictions all physical inspections are held privately with a Pennisi agent and a maximum of two prospective buyers from the same bubble.
Our team is working extended hours and all weekend to accommodate private inspections, however with more people requesting viewings than time slots available, appointments are allocated on a first in, first served basis for a maximum of 15 minutes.
To further protect our community, we invite you to view the 360 degree virtual tour before requesting a private inspection to ensure you are satisfied with the layout and location.
If you have viewed the virtual tour and are in a position to buy the property broadly within the indicated price, please call 9379 5616 to arrange a private viewing.
When your booking is confirmed, we'll greet you at the property with a smile (hidden behind our mask) instead of a handshake, then it's business as usual!
*Please DO NOT attend an inspection if you are feeling unwell, waiting for COVID test results or have been in contact with anyone who has recently been exposed to Covid-19.
Pennisi Real Estate Essendon thank you for your understanding and cooperation during this time and wish you every success with your property hunt.","SOLD - $800,000","3
