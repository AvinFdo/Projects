Bonjour, and welcome to quintessential French living whilst enjoying the comforts and benefits of the area's premier estate.
The property is adorned with French provincial characteristics including classical cornices, double-doors, white window shutters and a kitchen that fuses rustic French towns with Parisian suburban designs.

The 30.51sqm property itself features:

- Theatre room;
- Rumpus room;
- Open plan living/dining room that encapsulates an abundance of natural light;
- Lifted ceilings;
- Down lights throughout;
- An encompassing alfresco that gazes over the sprawling hills and watches peacefully as the sun rises in the east and sinks in the west;
- Double car garage;
- Genuine side access;
- Large block that spans just under 700sqm (one of the largest in the early Timbertop releases).
Add on top of this additional extras like:
- Ducted heating and evaporative cooling;
- Security door system;
- Gas fire place that looks like a genuine fire;
- Ducted vacuum system.
The list could continue into the night. To save you reading further, how about you just book in your European getaway to Toddington now?
