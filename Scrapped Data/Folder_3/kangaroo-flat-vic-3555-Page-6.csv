kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,282 MacKenzie Street West Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Central Kangaroo Flat Family Winner.
INSPECTION BY APPOINTMENT CONTACT JESSE FORBES 0477277600
A superb property in a superb location, 282 MacKenzie Street West provides true ease of living.
A primary school around the corner, a local park down the right or a short drive to Kangaroo Flat's shopping precinct or Bendigo CBD there is lots to love about its lifestyle offerings.
Set on a generous approx. 800m2 block sits this neatly presented 1970s style cream brick home offering plenty of natural light and recent updates.
A spacious lounge room with large windows, ornate cornices, built-in robes, ceiling fans and an abundance of storage options throughout.
Fresh touches to the bathroom and new wardrobes in the bedrooms add to the appeal of the home while the floor plan and original fittings provides the ideal opportunity to continue adding your style if you wish.
Control the climate all year round with ease thanks to refrigerated cooling and ducted gas heating.
The home continues to shine outdoors with its large undercover entertaining patio, secure fencing, established garden beds with fruit trees and plenty of shade, and a garden shed.
You'll be impressed with the 7m x 6m concreted and powered shed complete with log woodfire providing the ideal man cave and additional off-street parking options with the double carport.
Invest and bring in a rental income or move right in and plan for the future, contact agent Jesse Forbes for an inspection.

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,12 Clarcoll Crescent South Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"New, Modern and Very Appealing
Located within walking distance of Lansell Square, and close to Kangaroo Flat shops, sporting amenities and schools, is this new and modern home ideally suited to first home buyers, retirees and investors.
With the home sited on a 300m2 allotment, this property is low-maintenance and will appeal to those looking for an easy-care lifestyle.
The Welsh-built home is value-packed, and a rare opportunity for first home buyers to capitalise on the $20,000 First Home Buyers' grant.
Or alternatively, investors could achieve an estimated rental return $360 per week.
Presented to perfection, there really isn't anything to do but move in immediately and enjoy your new home.
The well-designed floorplan consists of three bedrooms, two with built-in robes and the master with its own walk-in robe and well-finished ensuite.
The main bathroom (including separate shower and bath) services the rest of the house.
Quality flooring throughout leads to the heart of the home. The kitchen has good cupboard storage and quality appliances including dishwasher.
The central living area is a nice place to relax with ducted heating and reverse-cycle split-system cooling/heating, providing comfort all year round.
This property has so much to offer and there's so much more than meets the eye.
The only thing left to do is come and inspect.","SOLD - $365,000","3
