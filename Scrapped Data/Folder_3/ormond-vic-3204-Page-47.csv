ormond-vic-3204,30 Bonny Street Bentleigh East VIC 3165,"Position & Solid Potential to Redevelop or Renovate
Build the future on this first-class land or live the dream in his classic cream-brick home. Situated amongst the prestige new development and quality renovations of this semi-crescent, this well-positioned property is offered with approx 606.5sqm land, a solid 1950s home and multiple possibilities.
Take inspiration from the neighbours and develop this desirable Bentleigh East address (subject to Council approval) to meet the demand for all-new family living in this evolving locale. Half a dozen blocks to well-regarded Tucker Rd Primary School, this prime site has the proportions (approx 15.24m x 39.8m) and position for a profitable project - just around the corner to King George IV Reserve, Chesterville Rd Village shopping and major bus-routes.
Alternatively, consider the proportions of the three-bedroom brick home already here. Wonderfully solid and well-maintained with a modern kitchen with stainless-steel dishwasher, an upgraded bathroom with separate WC, and big bedrooms with robes, this comfortable home offers a brilliant base for renovation and extension. At the very least, with glossy polished boards, gas-heating, an air-conditioner and garage, this easy-care home will pay its way through the planning process. There is even the possibility of retaining an excellent on-going tenant to make the transition seamless.","SOLD - $1,080,000","3
