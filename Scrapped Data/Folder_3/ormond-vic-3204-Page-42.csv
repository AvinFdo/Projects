Period Perfection with Contemporary Class
A private family sanctuary on a coveted corner block, this stylishly updated 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom Spanish Mission sensation is perfectly placed to highlight generously scaled living zones, quality finishes, and seamless indoor-outdoor transition.
Beyond an arched and elevated porch entry, discover far-reaching depth and wide open space in beautifully accommodating living and dining zones beneath soaring ceilings. A recently refreshed kitchen benefits from the full suite of high-end Asko appointments including twin ovens (electric and steam) a dishwasher, and an easy-clean induction cook top. Chef-friendly from top to bottom, take full advantage of an insinkerator, plenty of room for a double fridge, ample pantry space, and a sparkling series of stone bench tops.
A light-filled and air-conditioned family retreat fully opens up to reveal a sheltered alfresco deck, brilliantly book-ended by a sun lounge and a fire-pit area. Free-flowing and north-facing, make every social event an occasion in a privately peaceful outdoor oasis sure to be used on a daily basis.
The inspired, thoughtful layout accentuates family-sized space without sacrificing natural light. All 3 bedrooms are a testament to this with the roomy main boasting a fully tiled ensuite featuring a separate WC and huge wardrobe space. A skylit principal bathroom features a shower over a bath, while a recently renovated laundry is graced with a fully tiled, walk-in shower plus a stone-finished vanity.
Special features include ducted heating plus 3 split-system heating/cooling units and additional panel heating in the retreat, an outdoor shower, recessed down-lighting, a garden shed, original decorative ceilings, and off-street parking for 3 cars beyond auto-gated entry. The property is further enhanced by a number of updates and upgrades. Newly restumped, rewired and replumbed, enjoy brand-new, wide-board oak flooring, plantation shutters, sliding glass doors, fencing, and a freshly landscaped garden.
Pretty-as-a-picture over an impressive 540sqm (approx.), convenience is a constant in the tightly held Dendy Park precinct. Stroll to St Leonards College, Haileybury and Brighton Secondary College, lush parkland, and Hampton Street shopping. Make no mistake, this Mission is possible!
