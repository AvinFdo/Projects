Situated on a 495m2 block with side access, moments from the CBD sits an impressively renovated home within a 1930's California Bungalow shell.
Renovated by a quality builder himself, the choice of the impressive front door sets the standard for what is within the four walls of this Havlin Street property, that being a warm and loving home with mindful touches.
A seamless fusion of modern living and classic period features flow from front to back including hardwood timber floors, high ceilings, modern lighting, decorative cornices, ceiling roses and clever storage complete with a tasteful colour pallet.
Located at the front of the property is the master bedroom. Upon entering this spacious master bedroom, you will see the stunning feature wall, framing the bed setting perfectly. This master bedroom is exactly that, with a well-equipped his-and-hers walk-in-robe with sensor lighting and ample storage, flowing through to the fantastic ensuite with a spacious shower, sleek vanity and enclosed toilet.
The remaining two bedrooms are in the front half of the property and share the family bathroom featuring a luxurious corner spa, great sized shower and wall hung vanity unit.
In the centre of the home is the open plan dining adjoining the charming kitchen with quality fixtures and fittings throughout. Notably, the popular white subway splashback is the focal point, surrounded by storage, rich cabinetry, a 750mm gas stove, electric oven, double sink completed by the quality stone benchtops.
From here, you step up to the fantastic, light-filled lounge room adorned with exposed beams and sleek track lighting. This area houses a great study nook and branches off to the euro laundry. French doors frame the undercover entertaining area which leads to the paved alfresco and adjoins a luscious grass patch - the perfect setting for a weekend BBQ. A water tank and shed complete the backyard.
This home ticks all the boxes. An ideal property for those looking to downsize or upsize, something to add to your portfolio or a potential Air BnB close by to the city with plenty of opportunities to explore and enjoy Bendigo.","SOLD - $541,000","3
