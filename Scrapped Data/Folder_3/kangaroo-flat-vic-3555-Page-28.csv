Stunning and designed to impress is this modern, 4 bedroom family home that offers so much, in a location where you will appreciate the value and benefits this home presents.
Elevated with views off the back undercover, timber-decked entertaining area, you have a birds-eye view of so much.
Cathedral ceilings and square set decorative alcoves in the entrance gives you a hint of what's to come, with earthy neutral tones through the home, giving it a soothing feel.
Formal living to the front gives you all the peace and privacy one may need, and polished floorboards grace the split level living areas.
The huge open-plan kitchen, meals and family room takes you directly to the entertaining area.
Kitchen with storage and “A” class fixtures and fittings.
This house is generously proportioned and very well laid out, with ample room for the family in the rest of the house, where you will find the main bedroom with ensuite and walk-in robe, and three more double bedrooms (all with built-in robes), a purpose-built study, and a gorgeous family bathroom with a double shower, bath and double vanity.
Ducted gas heating and evaporative cooling provides cost efficient comfort all year round, while electricity and water costs are offset by a 3kw Solar system and a 3000 litre water tank.
