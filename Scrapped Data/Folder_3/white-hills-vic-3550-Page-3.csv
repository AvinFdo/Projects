white-hills-vic-3550,19 Plumridge Street White Hills VIC 3550,"COTTAGE CHARM IN AN ENVIABLE POSITION!
Situated in a sought-after White Hills position is this historic, character-filled and architect-influenced brick cottage offering scope as your own home, investment or supplementary income (yes, it is currently used for short-term accommodation - with constant clients).
Walk to Bendigo Creek walking tracks, schools and all the local shops, but best of all it is a stroll to White Hills Gardens and all the lovely features on offer there after its recent facelift.
The home boasts a superb custom-built kitchen with period-style cupboards, slate tiled floor, pot-drawers, walk-in pantry, dishwasher, gas hot plates and electric oven, ample bench space and a quirky microwave cavity; adjacent is the living area boasting a large reverse-cycle split-system, quality carpet and French Doors leading to the spacious, private alfresco space.
The dining room is cosy, features a slate floor and flows easily to the kitchen, it would also make a great private second living space. The three bedrooms are large, the main bedroom has its own reverse-cycle split system and a walk-in-robe; there's a second entry/foyer which would make a great study space and there is ample storage including a large walk-in linen press.
The bathroom is unique in shape and style, boasting a lovely claw-foot bath, large inset shower and a vanity basin made from a vintage timber cabinet; the laundry is of a similar taste to the bathroom and has outside access, adjacent is the separate toilet.
Outside is minimal maintenance with a private side yard with some foliage, a pond feature, paved brick and bluestone paths surrounding the home, local quarry rock retaining walls and a large paved area at the rear of the home which encompasses the covered alfresco space.
There is a shed/workshop with concrete floor, benches and built-in pegboard, a water tank and some additional storage.
The home has been re-floored, re-roofed and re-wired - you literally can walk in and do nothing; period features include pine-lined ceilings, feature brick walls (yes, the home is double brick), open fire places and an overall unique kerbside look and floor plan.
Worth viewing - it is one-of-a-kind in a one-of-a-kind location.","SOLD - $338,000","3
