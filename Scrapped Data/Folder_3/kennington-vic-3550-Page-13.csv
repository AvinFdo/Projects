Located in a peaceful avenue in a prime pocket of Kennington, an immaculate, yet easy to maintain garden including a gorgeous paved pathway and stone retaining walls make a wonderful first impression.
Stepping up onto the landing and through the front door you are greeted with an entryway of stunning polished hardwood floors and onto a bedroom, complete with built in robe. The master bedroom then follows with a built in dressing table and mirror, walk-in-robe and access trough to a cleverly designed semi-ensuite with shower. This flows onto a separate toilet and bathroom with a shower over bath and vanity which can also be accessed from the main hallway.
A study which could be utilised as a formal lounge, or kids activity room adds another layer of versatility to the home, as well as another two spacious bedrooms which both include built-in-robes and are all accessible just off the main hallway.
The kitchen, dining and living area is filled with natural light and views over the tranquil back garden. The kitchen has everything a cook could desire with ample bench and cupboard space and a sizeable pantry. The dining area offers plenty of room for a large family table and leads onto a generously sized, carpeted lounge room that showcases exposed ceiling trusses and can be closed off from the kitchen and dining area with timber bi-fold doors. Timber skirting boards and window architraves as well as stained glass room dividers add plenty of character and charm to the home.
Stairs from the kitchen lead down to a large and welcoming back yard that includes an established vegetable garden, fruit trees and chook pen allowing you to produce your own food, as well as a timber rotunda complete with a wood fired pizza oven – perfect for entertaining guests. A gate also provides direct access to a children’s playground where you can literally sit in the back yard while watching the kids enjoy themselves.

kennington-vic-3550,8 Knox Court Kennington VIC 3550,"Contemporary design, tranquil surrounds and a premium location!
Nestled into its tranquil surrounds, this striking custom built home has been cleverly designed to respond to the topography of its gentle sloping site at the end of a quiet court. Sheltered by quality built homes on the high side of the Reservoir; this blue chip property is perfectly positioned in walking distance to open parkland, Kennington Reservoir’s bushland reserves and only a short drive from Bendigo’s thriving arts and café culture.
The unique contemporary design features a series of gracefully curved rooflines and multi-level internal and external spaces that combine to create a home that is both sculptural and highly functional. The highly considered floorplan divides the split level property into a series of raised pavilions linked by internal glass bridges and raised timber decks resulting in beautifully finished spaces flooded with natural light.
High end design features are referenced throughout the clean lines of the home including honey coloured hard wood timber flooring, square set (no cornice) finishes, marble-look Tuscan ceramic tiling, sleek black window frames and external iron balustrades, distinctive floor to ceiling corner windows, internal smoked glass balustrading, soaring 3.6 metre and 2.7 metre high ceilings and custom built shelving and cabinetry - resulting in a minimalist contemporary Danish design aesthetic.
A formal entrance with raised landing overlooks the first of the three pavilions; each with a separate living zone, bedroom accommodation, bathroom facilities and internal sliders to connect or close off each space as needed. Located on the highest point of the block at street level; the first pavilion houses the formal living and luxurious master suite complete with hidden walk through robe, TV point and elegant dual access ensuite with vanity, frameless shower screen, toilet and heated towel rail.
The central pavilion comprises an enormous open plan kitchen-dining-living room, study or fourth bedroom with built in shelving and robes, guest powder room and family laundry. The chef designed G shaped kitchen features a dramatic black glass splashback, iridescent stone benchtops, double sink and stainless steel appliances including a new dishwasher and 900mm cooker with 6 burner gas cooktop and electric oven. The custom built kitchen includes elegant backlit glass display cabinets, cleverly hidden appliance storage and a large walk in pantry with floor to ceiling shelving and provision for a refrigerator.
The lower pavilion houses a large family games room, two double bedrooms with built in robes and family bathroom with bath, vanity, shower and separate powder room. The series of raised external desks include a combination of sophisticated open and covered outdoor entertaining spaces that can be accessed through glass sliders on all three levels. These capitalise on the parkland and water views that make this location so highly sought after.
Further features include:
- Hydronic heating & split system heating & cooling in all three pavilions
- Ceiling fans indoors and outdoors
- Double garage with auto door plus additional workshop or storage capacity
- Secure internal access from garage to formal entrance hall
- New 8 panel 1.5 KW solar system
- Side gate side access to fully secure rear yard
- Colourbond fencing with rear gate access to sporting fields & reservoir
- Sleek external blinds for additional internal temperature control
- Additional under-house general and rainwater storage
- Meticulously maintained and fully landscaped surrounds featuring mop tops, hedging, drought tolerant plantings and dripper system
Only minutes from schools and local shops and cafes including the new Kennington Village and Edwards Providore; this is a unique, stylish and versatile home built without compromise.","SOLD - $765,000","4
