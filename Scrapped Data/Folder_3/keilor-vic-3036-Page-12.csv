keilor-vic-3036,18 Watson Rise Keilor VIC 3036,"PRICE REDUCTION - An Architectural Showpiece
Enjoying an expansive outlook over Keilor Village, this award-winning, five bedroom plus study home is a synergistic statement of innovative architecture. Cleverly designed to exploit a sloping aspect, room definition is achieved through level changes rather than wall enclosures, with three enormous free-flowing living zones intertwined through mezzanine floors. The elevated study overlooks all areas, whilst an enormous, sliding retractable door separates formal and informal living domains, offering both flexible entertaining spaces and valuable privacy, achieving a harmonious family environment. North facing sunshine penetrates the home through floor to ceiling glass, seamlessly transitioning indoor living to two substantial entertaining decks. Four of the spacious bedrooms (WIRs/BIRs) feature dramatic, high curved ceilings mimicking the roof and opening to private decks and balconies, master also with sky-lit ensuite. Endless extras include ducted heating, split system climate control, alarm, Tasmanian Oak floors and remote double garage. Also near Overnewton College, Keilor Primary School, Keilor Village Shopping, public transport and Calder Freeway.","SOLD - $870,000","5
