kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,44 Magellan Crescent Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"One with the lot with equity
Introducing itself to visitors with a facade featuring finials, and return verandah with timber fretwork and turned wooden posts, this family-friendly home promotes happiness and harmony. Step inside to find a welcoming interior, well-warmed in wintery weather and cooled in summer swelter by ducted heating along with split system air conditioning.
A flexible floorplan and vast living zones allow variance of furniture configurations and room uses. For instance, with so much space for a desk elsewhere, the study could be a 5th bedroom or do double duty as a guest room. A bay window in the master bedroom is ideal for creating a cosy retreat, and if formal dining is not required, perhaps lounge and music or games room?
Complete with stainless steel gas cooktop, electric wall oven and dishwasher, the galley kitchen has abundant cabinetry, including small appliance cupboard. The aftermath of mealtime mayhem is kindly concealed from diners behind a raised splashback. An abundance of space here is also perfect for supervising homework at the breakfast bar or dining table, or youngsters at play either indoors or beyond in the fully-fenced yard.
Beckoning barbeques with family and friends, a brilliant undercover entertaining area is handy for sheltering kids and pets alfresco too. Alongside is a you-beaut shed with concrete floor, power and roller door, plus vehicle access via a double carport.
Just a few minutes' walk from both primary school and secondary college, with scope for updates at your leisure to increase equity, this home has it all!","SOLD - $410,000","4

This very central position is just a short stroll to Lansell Plaza as well as Aldi, IGA and the Kangaroo Flat Shopping Strip just up the road, together with the Leisure Centre and soon to be completed new Pool complex. Medical centres and schools are also not far away.
From the porch, glass panel double doors open to a wide hallway and a very spacious lounge featuring lovely timber flooring which also graces the 3 bedrooms. All bedrooms have picture rails, the main with a wall of robes and the second with some re-stumping needed. The central bathroom has a tiled floor, shower over bath and a timber fronted vanity, while the large kitchen has an electric upright stove, original cabinetry and a unique and original Metters wood stove still in place. With high ceilings and decorative cornice, the home has an air-conditioner, gas wall furnace and an attractive brick surround to a disconnected oil heater, which would make a lovely setting for perhaps a gas log fire.
Outside is a small covered entertainment area, carport, fully fenced deep back yard with storage shed and the bonus of three fruit trees.
