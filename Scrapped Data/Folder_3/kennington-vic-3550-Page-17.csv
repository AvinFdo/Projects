kennington-vic-3550,9 Condon Street Kennington VIC 3550,"Sought-after location with loads of potential
Positioned in a lovely, quiet, tree-lined street, is this 1930's Californian Bungalow, offering the opportunity to enhance to its full potential with a modest upgrade in some areas, or with plenty of room to extend as well.
The home features formal lounge and dining rooms with beautifully polished flooring, high art-deco ceilings and original leadlight windows.
The entry also has polished floor boards, with the original untouched timber panelling that enhances the character of the home.
Offering 3 bedrooms, one is study-sized, but the front living room could also be reconfigured to make the home 3 bedrooms plus study and one living area.
This living area has original, built-in, buffet-styled cupboards with lead light doors, and a split-system cooler, plus the entire home has had ducted gas heating installed.
The bathroom is modest but practical with a shower over bath, vanity unit and 2nd toilet.
The kitchen is of a good size with an upright gas stove and built-in cupboards, and still leaving enough room for a table.
At the rear is an enclosed rear porch, with entry to the study, separate toilet and a spacious laundry.
The home has had many upgrades including a new roof, rewired, hot water service and all internal appliances.
An outside paint would certainly enhance its appearance, and allows you to pick your own colour scheme.
Located close to Bendigo South East campus, St Therese's and St Joseph's primary schools, is certainly a big plus for a family intending to reap the benefits of its location.
The home is just a short stroll to many of Bendigo's CBD attractions, and has recreational parks close by.
If you're looking for a home in the right location, and happy to do a little renovation or extension, look no further. Homes of this calibre and location are snapped up quickly, so your early inspection is highly recommended.","SOLD - $351,000","3

kennington-vic-3550,6/26 Hodgkinson Street Kennington VIC 3550,"SPACIOUS UNIT IN EXCELLENT ORDER
Tucked away at the rear of a lovely, quiet complex is this immaculate unit that is sure to impress even the fussiest of buyers. Private and secure, the property has been impeccably maintained and presents in excellent order throughout, allowing the purchaser to move in immediately with nothing left to spend. And with vacant possession available immediately, that's quite literally what you can do!
A light, bright and extra spacious floor plan (for a unit) awaits, and thanks to recent improvements, is as fresh and vibrant as the day it was built. New carpets have been laid, whilst the entire interior has been freshly painted. Ducted heating has been recently installed throughout to complement the air conditioner for full temperature control. Two or three bedrooms provide ample accommodation, all complete with built in robes and two have ceiling fans. The third bedroom located at the rear of the garage will serve as the perfect guest room or study if required. Convenient is the generous sized bathroom featuring shower and double vanity, with plenty of room still available to install a bath. At the centre of the home is the oversized open plan living hub, with loads of natural light pouring through feature bay window and sliding glass doors to outside. Sharing this space is the well appointed kitchen, boasting quality timber cabinetry, electric wall oven, gas hot plates and dishwasher. Adjacent is the laundry which has ample storage facilities – a feature consistent with the home.
Outdoors there is a sheltered patio area to enjoy entertaining through all seasons. The low maintenance yard is all you need to be able to lock and leave and come and go as you please without the worry. The established and easy care gardens are aesthetically pleasing, and have been set up to easily maintain thanks to the in-ground sprinkler system. A single garage with auto door provides secure parking, and has direct internal access to the home
Close to shops, transport and other major amenities, this spacious and immaculate unit is perfect for singles/couples of all ages, and is ideal for retirees or the elderly. Inspection is a must, as you wont find anything better on the market today!","SOLD - $320,000","3
