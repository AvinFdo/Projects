kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,16 Irontree Close Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Family Home At Forest Lake
Only a short stroll from Forest Lake, this home will have you feeling welcome the minute you step inside the door. Although, even with such a stunning interior, it certainly invites impressive outdoor living!
Lounge and living rooms are well-separated by a study, meals area and an exquisite kitchen. It features 900mm stove, dishwasher, pot-drawers, breakfast bar amongst marble-look benches and superb cabinetry. An immense walk-in pantry can conceal bulk storage and small appliances.
There's a sizeable laundry, substantial family bathroom with shower, ensuite and walk-in robe to main bedroom plus built-in robes to the other 2 bedrooms. Connected to NBN, on solar power to minimise energy expenses, with split system air conditioning for seasonal climate control, it's got convenience and comfort covered too. Ample rooftop storage is accessible via a drop-down ladder in the man hole.
Serenity and semi-rural scenery greets party-goers and those that simply gather to relax upon the vast decking under the 'Vergola' roof. Mature native trees along the boundary rest against a backdrop of more soaring eucalypts, as no rear neighbours impede privacy. Surrounding fernery, fishpond, hen-house and garden shed on concrete, the big backyard is fully fenced. In the front yard, a double carport and attractive landscaping complete the package.
Close to school, college and walking trails through the State Forest, it's also near a bus route taking travellers into Bendigo and to local amenities.
So when the swans swim past with their cygnets next nesting season, will it be you seeing them on your daily stroll with the family, just 300 metres from your door?

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,1 Giudice Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Peaceful And Picture Perfect
Repainted and refurbished, this immaculate classic property simply exudes serenity from every corner. Not an inch unkempt, it allows its next owners to merely move-in and relax, or prepare for the house-warming party.
A kaleidoscope of colourful flora hugs winding paths through well-groomed peaceful gardens where long established fruit trees, shrubs and lawn thrive. Encircling the sheltered paved barbeque area, they also provide picturesque vistas for indoor dwellers.
At the centre of the home are 2 inviting living/dining zones, either side of a perfectly appointed kitchen with walk-in pantry. A dishwasher and electric cooking appliances have been fitted amongst beautiful cabinetry that incorporate pot drawers. Built-in robes are found in all 4 bedrooms, but the king-size master also possesses an enviable ensuite. Spa with twin headrests, double vanity and separate toilet ensure parental stress disappears here. Solar hot water saves energy, whilst electric floor heating plus refrigerated heating and cooling guarantee constant comfort.
Oversized for extra storage, room for trailer and workshop, the garage has single roller door, concrete floor, power and attached double carport. Storeroom and rainwater tank in the backyard are further bonuses.
Kids can take a shortcut to nearby school and college via Freeman Drive. Medical amenities, shopping and train station are all very close too. Near the Calder Highway, plus with a bus stop around the corner taking travellers into Bendigo and Lansell Square every 30 minutes, it's an incredibly convenient location for commuters too.
