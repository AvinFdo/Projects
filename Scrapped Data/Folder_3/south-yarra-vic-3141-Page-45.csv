south-yarra-vic-3141,1/27 Rockley Road South Yarra VIC 3141,"Vintage Elegance With Ground Floor Ease
In one of South Yarra’s most renowned tree lined streets, vintage elegance, leafy surrounding views and an elevated north facing ground floor front position form the irresistible combination that makes this two bedroom apartment such a stand out success. Loved and enjoyed by four generations of the one family, its thoughtfully updated generous dimensions present a fabulous entry point, investment or downsize opportunity just a short walk from Rockley Gardens, Toorak Road trams and all the action of Chapel Street. In a manicured garden block, two spacious double bedrooms with BIRs sit either side of a wide central hall, the larger main with ensuite, sharing their tranquil garden outlooks with a large sitting room, leafy balcony and adjoining dining. A renovated modern kitchen featuring stone benchtops and stainless steel appliances offers immediate appeal along with a bathroom that includes an updated vanity and laundry taps. An additional storage room, a rare luxury in an apartment of this type, heads a list of extras that includes gas heating and gas “on demand” hot water heating, new carpet, intercom security and undercover parking.","SOLD - $890,000","2
