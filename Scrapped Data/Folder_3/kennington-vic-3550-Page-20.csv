kennington-vic-3550,18 Hodgkinson Street Kennington VIC 3550,"Modern Cottage Situated Minutes Away From The Heart of Bendigo!
Situated only minutes away from the heart of Bendigo and just one block from the McIvor Road commercial centre, this modern cottage style home offers potential owners a great location and lifestyle opportunity. Sitting on a large block in one of Kenningtons most sought after pockets, number 18 Hodgkinson Street presents an ideal opportunity for couples, small families, retirees, investors or those buying their first home.
The home features a well sized, recently updated kitchen which has plenty of bench and cupboard space and modern amenities. The living and dining room are combined into an open plan living area which is complimented by 9 foot ceilings, a solid fuel heater, ceiling fan, refrigerated split system AC/heater and decorative ceiling rose features.
The two bedrooms are spacious and include original features such as the decorative ceiling rose, open fireplace and timber framed sash windows. The master bedroom also includes a built in robe. The family bathroom has been recently renovated and is functional and of good size. The laundry is also well sized and features a second toilet. Keeping to its cottage style, this house has polished hardwood floorboards throughout, a large central entry hall and a recently painted weatherboard exterior.
An extensive garden and large backyard with an outdoor seating area makes the perfect setting for entertaining. A bonus feature of the established garden includes an array of fruit trees including plums, nectarines, apples, pears, raspberries, strawberries, grapes, almonds and pomegranates - which are all watered by three 2000L rain water tanks and an electric pump.
The large rear yard also lends itself to further subdivision (STCA), which is assisted by the wide driveway and lack of planning overlays (e.g. no Heritage Overlay).
The property is also fully fenced and includes a large colorbond shed which is connected to electricity and an attached car port / pergola. Additional features of note include underfloor and ceiling insulation.
An inspection is a must for this gem of a home.","SOLD - $325,000","2

kennington-vic-3550,108 Edwards Road Kennington VIC 3550,"PRIME OPPORTUNITY IN A FANTASTIC POSITION
This immaculate property, having being occupied by a single owner since its build in 1961, is an amazing opportunity in a great location. Situated directly across from Strath Village Shopping Centre, bus stop right out the front and walking distance to schools, La Trobe University and many other amenities, this neat and tidy yellow brick home offers loads of potential.
With ample off-street parking and a concrete drive leading down to double garage, this neat yellow brick home offers a lovely garden with established rose bushes. The paved front entry opens into a wide hall, complete with built-in coat closet and glass sliding doors lead into the light and bright living area. Double aspect windows and a gas heater offer plenty of warmth and this generous space opens on to another living area, which could also be used as a formal dining. A third living area, created as a sunroom/conservatory at the rear of the property, means there is plenty of scope for living arrangements.
Quality timber floorboards can be found under the carpeted areas of the home and the owners have recently installed ducted heating and cooling throughout. Large windows provide plenty of natural light and quality details, such as ornate architraves, indicate the quality of the original build.
The second living space leads through to the bright and light open plan kitchen and dining room. Refurbished to freshen the space and include all modern conveniences; this room still retains a retro feel and the spacious, built-in pantry is a wonderful addition.
Other internal features include a neat linen press in the hallway providing extra storage, a large disabled access bathroom offers ample space for a wheelchair or walker. An additional separate toilet is also hugely practical.
Back towards the front of the home, three good-sized bedrooms all feature built-in robes and ceiling fans.
A sliding door through to the hallway will take you to a large laundry with built-in storage. A wide ramp leading down to the backyard is perfect for wheelchair and/or disabled access. The neat, lawned garden also features a paved, undercover space; an open paved area with a built-in BBQ; raised garden bed and planting throughout. Access from both the driveway and the side gate at the other end of the house provide practical connections to the rear of the house.
This practical and well-designed home has lovingly served a local family for years and it is ideal for a young family, retirees searching for a convenient location, or even a clinical practice after a high profile, easily accessible destination.","SOLD - $350,000","3
