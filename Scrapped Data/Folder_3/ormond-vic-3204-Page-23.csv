ormond-vic-3204,1/14 Ormond Road Ormond VIC 3204,"Location & lifestyle will impress
While the design of this townhouse is urban chic, the lifestyle it offers is peaceful, low maintenance and relaxing. It is the perfect blend of form and function. The spacious open plan living room (A/C) flows into a stylish eat-in kitchen with stainless steel appliances. Upstairs, there are two bedrooms (with built-in wardrobes) that have their own access to the shared bathroom. The shady rear courtyard is partly paved and provides plenty of alfresco entertaining space in a private environment. Among the inclusions - powder room, Euro laundry, ducted heating, and garage with direct entry to the house. Street-front and on its own title, this home earns even more acclaim for its location in walking distance to Ormond shops, cafes and train station and to parks, reserves, recreation, buses and schools.

The full family package filled with prestige extras and set on its own full-sized approx 584sqm block, this is the full McKinnon College Zone family package! Showcasing an architect-designed extension featuring family-wise triple zone living, this 4 bedroom, 3.5 bathroom home stars a traditional formal lounge with stone-fronted fireplace, expansive north-facing family living opening to a covered al fresco area, and a versatile first-floor retreat with room for work or play.
Innovatively designed with a choice of vast master-suite upstairs or down (one with balcony, one with bay-window, both with WIRs and ensuites), this distinctive home is architecturally detailed with a soaring entry void, tall windows bracketing for the DeLonghi and granite kitchen and a lofty mezzanine-style first-floor hallway. Appointed with all the extras including reverse-cycle air-conditioners, ducted heating and vacuum and an alarm, there's plenty of room for kids to play in sunny northerly landscaped gardens and plentiful parking (with room for at least four cars) on a semi-circle driveway and carport.
Even the location is full of benefits - just two blocks from the back gates of the Secondary College, an easy walk to McKinnon Primary School and a stroll to local shopping and McKinnon Reserve!","SOLD - $1,870,000","4

Wow! A high quality renovation and much more space than you'd expect in a one-bedroom apartment has created a chic contemporary home in the heart of Ormond. On the ground-floor of the block, this apartment is full of surprises. Hard-wearing bamboo flooring is the first noticeable style statement. It is a feature of the spacious open living room where a superior kitchen has stone benchtops, new Bosch cooker with gas hotplates, an integrated single-drawer dishwasher, and glossy cabinetry. The double bedroom (ceiling fan) has mirror-fronted BIRs and a bright fully tiled bathroom/ensuite with laundry facilities. A private rear courtyard is the icing on the cake! Security is an additional feature, with remote-controlled gates to the carport, and intercom entry to the apartment. Whip around the corner to the train station and buses in the Ormond shopping centre. Be in the CBD or at Monash Uni (Caulfield) in a flash. Relish the close proximity to cafes, recreation and reserves. Love the lifestyle this apartment offers!
