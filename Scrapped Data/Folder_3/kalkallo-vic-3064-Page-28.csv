kalkallo-vic-3064,52 Aldergrove Parade Mickleham VIC 3064,"Quality Built home - FREE electricity and gas
NEVER PAY ELECTRICITY AND GAS EVER!
If PRIVACY AND SECURITY is on top of your list, than look no further.
This lovely home is thoughtfully designed for a lifestyle of sophisticated Home Luxury, complimented with the finest interior features.
The inviting porch entry leads to an impressive foyer, drawing the eye to the bright elegant formal room with beautiful window furnishings. The well-appointed kitchen features a waterfall stone island bench used at times as a convenient breakfast bar for informal dining, with plenty of counter and cabinet space, complimented with a desirable butler's pantry.
The picture perfect and deluxe living / family / dining area offering stylish touches with bulk head feature walls and comfort for your convenience.
The charming master bedroom is both elegant and warmly inviting, enhanced by a large walk-in closet, en-suite with modern vanity, lux shower with modern easy to maintain tiles. Each of the three secondary bedrooms are equally warm and welcoming and designed for stylish comfort and convenience.
In years to come, you will be glad you purchased this lovely family home nestled in the peaceful pocket of the Annadale Estate, Mickleham. Annadale is a place that makes you feel like you can escape, but at the same time find everything you need at your fingertips from the more established neighboring suburbs.
Benefit from the amenities Craigieburn offers today and the convenience of the future proposed town centre.
You will be part of a family-oriented community, surrounded with parks and walking trails, proposed schools for all ages and world class facilities and just a short drive from the Proposed new Merrifield Harbour Estate.
