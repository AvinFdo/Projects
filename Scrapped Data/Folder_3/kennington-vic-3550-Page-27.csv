kennington-vic-3550,10 Kara Street Kennington VIC 3550,"Perfectly positioned and presented
A short walk to Strath/Kennington Villages and local schools in a quiet street in highly sought after Kennington is this perfectly positioned '50s weatherboard home. The original character has been tastefully retained but perfectly blended with contemporary styling. This home truly has to be seen to be fully appreciated.
In the large living-room north facing wall-to-wall / floor-to-ceiling picture windows overlook the lush, private front garden - a real point of difference. A gas log fire and reverse cycle A/C keep the open plan living/dining/kitchen areas comfortable. The very appealing and spacious kitchen has a large island bench, 12 pot-drawers, double pantry, electric wall oven, gas hot plates, dishwasher and opens onto the private decked area.
There is a central fully modernised 3 piece bathroom and separate toilet and the over-sized laundry allows space for easy conversion to an en-suite bathroom if required.
Three very large bedrooms with built in robes and ceiling fans and one with split system A/C.
Current owner (only the 2nd) has lived here for 26 years, so everything needed to make this house a wonderful liveable home is done - external blinds, quality drapes/window coverings, modernised and well maintained and the out-side painted 4 years ago. Beautiful established low maintenance gardens surround the home and shade trees include Japanese Maples, Crab Apples and an Oak.
Enjoy the large, private elevated decking area - perfect for entertaining or relaxing under the shade of an oak tree.
Other features include 9'6"" ceilings, new gas HWS, 2 water tanks, extensive under-house storage (or man cave??), excellent fencing, raised vegetable garden, extensive paving and weatherboard garden shed. A single carport with room for another car.","SOLD - $377,000","3
