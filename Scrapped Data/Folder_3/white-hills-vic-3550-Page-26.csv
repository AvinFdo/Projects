white-hills-vic-3550,115-123 St Killian Street WHITE HILLS VIC 3550,"Rare Development Opportunity
There are some who will look at this home on two separate titles totalling one-and-a-half acres (6070 square metres), and see the potential for multiple units (STCA), especially given that it's a rare opportunity to develop one of the last sizeable allotments in the area; and then others who will look and see a solid, light-filled four-bedroom home with a delightful ambience surrounded by a garden enthusiastically nurtured over many years. You can't do better than a heavenly home in a saintly street and this four-bedroom home fits the bill. Open-plan living is at one end while the bedrooms and bathroom are at the other. Large windows open up the home and frame aspects of the restful garden - flowers, foliage and trees - all round. The kitchen and meals area is roomy and bright. A wide two-door pantry stocks enough supplies for a big family and the gas cooktop and one-and-a-half-ovens caters for big numbers. Sliding doors open onto a long patio. For more formal occasions the dining room is ideal and opens off a spacious lounge both of which take in those superb views. Ducted gas heating and evaporative cooling are throughout. Two of the four bedrooms have generous built-in wardrobes and all have ceiling fans. There's also a two-piece bathroom, separate toilet and laundry. Externally, apart from the magnificent garden, there is a ripper of a double garage and workshop, 10m x 12m, steel-framed and solid brick, containing a basin and toilet and featuring a concrete floor, power, light and phone connection. There is also a second, smaller steel-framed shed. Offered with vacant possession.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"4
