south-yarra-vic-3141,19 Gordon Grove South Yarra VIC 3141,"Expression Of Interest Closing 22 June at 10:30am
An immensely appealing masterpiece of 1960s architecture originally designed by Roy Grounds and Robin Boyd, two of Australias most influential architects and sympathetically restored over recent years by Studio 35 Architecture, this stunning family home boasts an unwavering dedication to bold modernist architectural style, contemporary finesse and light-infused living. A rare dual frontage from both the quiet cul-de-sac of Gordon Grove and Caroline Street allows pedestrian access and car parking from both ends of the home. Secure fencing encases the lush private gardens extending to an elevated north facing alfresco entertaining terrace with a curving pathway and bluestone paving leading to the salt-water plunge pool. Views across the rooftops of surrounding suburbs and glorious sun dappled aspects from each window have been thoughtfully implemented to take full advantage of the north/east position and the interior has been lavishly adorned with evocative detailing such as limed timber ceiling and walls, marbled concrete floors and extensive built-in cabinetry. Spaciously spread across three levels, the floorplan showcases five bedrooms (BIRs) including an upstairs master retreat with original sculptural brass fireplace, living zone with balcony access plus a luxe ensuite featuring twin basins and a double shower, a vast home office, lower level games/rumpus room, expansive living room with Cheminee Philippe feature fireplace, Gaggenau equipped kitchen with Carrara marble benches, integrated fridge/freezer and dishwasher, dining zone, a further living room with elevated views, family bathroom with separate bath, powder room and a fully appointed laundry. Secure carport and bike storage, heating/cooling, alarm and speaker system are just a few of the highlights whilst a position within walking distance of prestigious private schools, Botanic Gardens, Yarra River bike and walking trails plus Toorak Road shops and Melbournes sports and entertainment precinct are sure to impress.
