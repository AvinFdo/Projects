With the gates of Joyce Park at the street's end, McKinnon Primary and Secondary within steps and a choice of rail, retail and dining destinations in either direction, this is the true heart of the state's most sought after school zone. Representing an increasingly rare opportunity to acquire a significant land parcel at this lifestyle locale, this expansive approx. 752sqm property is ready to stimulate the market's strong demand for high impact, low maintenance luxury with a brand new home or two (subject to Council approval).
