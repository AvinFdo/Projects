epping-vic-3076,95 Peppercorn Parade Epping VIC 3076,"Fabulous First Step Towards A Wonderful Future
Perfectly presented, in a fabulous spot and featuring ducted heating and cooling, polished timber floors, roller shutters and a relaxed flow between indoors and out, this superb family home is the ideal opportunity for first home buyers looking to enjoy easy living from day one.
Formal living dining complements a large family meals zone which includes a pristine kitchen and opens to a decked alfresco. Clever design has it stepping down to a multi vehicle carport behind a roller door that delivers further spaces for entertaining, or for the kids to enjoy on a wet day, when they don't want to be inside. A dedicated BBQ area keeps the cooking spaces separate from the entertaining.
Close enough to the school the kids should never be late again and a short walk from Greenbrook Village, it is seriously central to both Epping Plaza and Epping Train Station.
