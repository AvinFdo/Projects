whittington-vic-3219,222 Andersons Road Barrabool VIC 3221,"Unique opportunity to create your own haven in the Barrabool Hills.
Stunning undulating countryside provides spectacular views youll never tire of at this rare slice of the highly sought Barrabool Hills.
First time offered, the 2013sqm property was originally part of the Strathlachlan Estate and held by the one family since 1851. It presents a unique opportunity to create a tranquil, private haven with a manageable land size just 10 minutes from Highton Village and the Princes Highway Ring Road.
The builders own home was built to last in 1967 and displays plenty of mid-century charm to update, renovate or redevelop, and add your own modern stamp to the original brick dwelling that includes features such as a timber panelled entry and painted brick feature wall in the lounge room. There are timber floors waiting to be uncovered beneath the carpet and ample space to renovate the central kitchen with a new electric wall oven and cooktop, walk-in pantry and large servery window onto the living room. Deep windows and sliding doors link the lounge and two front bedrooms to a terrace and frame lovely views of the surrounding hills, with no neighbours in sight.
The vista over Mt Moriac is a highlight of the kitchen and dining area at the rear. All three bedrooms in the main house have large built-in wardrobes and share an updated bathroom and separate toilet. A second self-contained dwelling provides a fourth bedroom and study or potential fifth bedroom. With its own entry, kitchen and bathroom, it would be ideal for a teenager, ageing parent or even Airbnb. Outside a double garage with through access and separate single garage and large workshop are perfect for those who like to tinker.
The property is nine minutes from Moriac, 20 minutes from the Geelong CBD and surf coast beaches, 30 minutes from the Avalon Airport and 70 minutes from Melbourne. Commuters can travel from the front gate to the West Gate Bridge without encountering a traffic light.","SOLD - $715,000","4
