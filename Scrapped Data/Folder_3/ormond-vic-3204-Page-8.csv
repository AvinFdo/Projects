ormond-vic-3204,51 Murray Road Ormond VIC 3204,"Create the Dream in the College Zone
An irresistible renovator, this rare 2 bedroom 2-storey Art Deco one of a pair is a fairytale opportunity to make it this delightful home something magical again. Retaining its classic ceilings, this homely retreat enjoys an entry foyer with loads of storage, a charming lounge, sun filled dining room with French doors onto a paved north facing courtyard garden; a retro 70s kitchen with electric stove, central bathroom, separate toilet, a large laundry and a lock up garage. The uniqueness of this home means the two lovely bedrooms (BIRs) are upstairs, yet feel connected with the home. With so much potential to add your cosmetic taste, change the layout and even extend, it's a fantastic vision to make it beautiful again. An excellent unit alternative with no common land, it's superbly located in the McKinnon Secondary College zone, around the corner from McKinnon Village, the train and Joyce Park, walk to North Road eateries and buses to Monash University.","SOLD - $750,000","2
