white-hills-vic-3550,26 Marshall Crescent Kennington VIC 3550,"GREAT BONES!
A typical home of its era - built to last with old school building techniques and quality products that are hard to find in modern home design. Popular cream brick veneer, terracotta tiled roof, hardwood frame, polished timber floors and concrete stumps. Yes this home is arguably as solid as it was the day it was built!
This means great bones for you to retain as is, update, renovate, extend or simply put some great tenants in there making it a wise investment.
The home is positioned on a 483m2 corner lot in elevated Marshall Crescent surrounded by neat and tidy homes. It boasts a spacious lounge room on entry with mantel, gas heater, reverse-cycle split-system and polished timber floors; there is the adjacent meals area and the original but well-kept kitchen including ample cabinetry and overhead cupboards, bench-top gas hot plates and oven, double sink and a Dishlex dishwasher. To the side of the meals space is separate sunroom-come-study nook.
Three spacious bedrooms, two have built-in-robes, two have trendy corner windows and they all have polished floorboards! The family bathroom is almost original, but in great order, there's a shower, basin and separate bath.
The laundry is a good size and has a double trough; the toilet is separate.
Outside, there is the original cream brick fence, a double carport with easy parking access and lots of scope to add your own touch outside.
Position is superb, transport is handy, it is a short walk to Primary Schools, close to Kennington Village and Strath Village and five mins to Bendigo's CBD.
Be quick and take advantage of one of Kennington's most sough-after locations!","SOLD - $377,777","3

white-hills-vic-3550,9 Albert Street Long Gully VIC 3550,"Affordable Allotment
In 1851 Margaret Kennedy struck gold in the Bendigo Creek sparking the gold rush of history. Between then and 1954 more than 700,000kg of gold was discovered, representing a value of more than $30b in today's prices.
Sitting between two modern homes on Albert Street, this 682m2 allotment is positioned in the locality known as St Just Point. Named in honour of the Cornish miners who populated the area and brought their mining technology, skill and culture to Bendigo.
The allotment is fully fenced in Colorbond with gateway access to Albert Street and a 17m frontage. The site is clear of easements and restrictive covenants. It has access to all town services and is affordably priced. It's a great option for those who love the idea of a new home or investment property (subject to council approval) outside of the more densely populated housing estates. A drive along Albert Street will reveal the gentrification of the area and the modern homes that have been constructed in recent years.
Living here is living just a stroll from the Long Gully Reserve, the Water Splash Park and the Derwent Drive play space. It's a short 5 minute drive to the Bendigo CBD. Education options include close proximity to several primary schools: St Peter's PS, Lighting Reef PS and California Gully PS. While a short 3 minute drive to Maiden Gully provides great access to the highly reputed F-12 Marist College Bendigo and Maiden Gully PS. There's also great access to Long Gully IGA and Maiden Gully IGA, child care services, the Bendigo District RSL and much more.
Please call me at any time to arrange an inspection and to request a copy of the Section 32.","SOLD - $140,000",682mÂ²,Vacant land,Sold by private treaty 29 Jun 2020,"9 Albert Street, Long Gully VIC 3550 was last sold in 2020.","ALL

white-hills-vic-3550,37 BUTTON STREET Strathdale VIC 3550,"AMAZING DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY - 2,279 sqm.
Phone Enquiry ID:46499
Residential land: $395,000
AMAZING DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY - 2,279 sqm (approx.)
At the end of a quiet court, this expansive, north-facing, half-acre block is perched at the height of Mc Ivor Hill!
Surrounded by quality, established homes on smaller, residential-sized blocks, its not hard to see why properties in this tightly-held pocket are rarely released back to the market - and are snapped up quickly when they are!
When you then consider the half-acre size of this vacant, residential allotment, this opportunity is truly, a rare commodity that is highly unlikely to present itself again.
Offering a fantastic building canvas to play with - with a wide 20m (approx.) street frontage fanning out to 58.7m (approx.) at the rear, theres a variety of possibilities for either subdivision (STCA) - or just your own dream family home; taking advantage of the wide block and northerly aspect to incorporate the design and layout you want - not just what the standard house-block usually allows.
This well established neighbourhood has all utility services available to connect - so its ready to start construction whenever you are.
But this sensational address offers a lot more than beautiful, elevated escarpments and fresh air - its less than 5km from the heart of Bendigo CBD!
Go and have a look at the block and magnificent views for yourself, you wont be disappointed.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"2,279mÂ²",Vacant land,Sold by private treaty 20 Jul 2020,"37 BUTTON STREET, Strathdale VIC 3550 was last sold in 2020.","ALL
