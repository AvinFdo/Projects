Only one of two on the block and boasting its own street frontage and no common land on a smart 215sqm (approx.) allotment, this superb starter, downsizing option or investment enjoys a strong sense of style and superior level of convenience thanks to its close proximity to scenic parkland, well-regarded schools, Epping train station, bus services, Epping Plaza, the Northern Hospital and freeway access.
Carpeted floors add a touch of comfort and luxury to all three generous-sized bedrooms (master with walk-in robe and ensuite), while a radiant open-plan living domain makes a statement of its own with its excellent sense of space, quality tiled flooring, wonderful high ceilings, uplifting natural light and modern kitchen equipped with spacious benchtops, stainless steel appliances and loads of storage space.
The interior's integration with the enclosed alfresco makes indoor-outdoor entertaining an enjoyable experience any time of year, while the benefits of living with ducted heating and evaporative cooling means you can also enjoy perfect indoor climate levels all year long.
A contemporary colour scheme makes redecorating easy, while a private driveway leading into a remote single garage with an additional car space in front, security alarm and easy-care gardens are further highlights.","SOLD - $465,000","3
