kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,5 Wallaby Avenue Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Retro revival or contemporary dream has huge shed!
Barely anything has been altered at this address since it was built. But that merely means this particular property has so much scope for either a simple or spectacular make-over. Whether cosmetic or complete, any upgrading could create a retro revival or conversion into a contemporary dream. In the galley kitchen that has extensive benches and copious cupboards, a dishwasher, wall oven and gas cooktop assist at mealtimes. Segregated but not isolated, a servery window is open to the lounge. Depending upon occupant's requirements, the floorplan offers flexibility. With cosy gas log fire and sunny corner window, the L-shaped lounge has plenty of space for table and chairs alongside sofas. If so, the formal dining room could be a 2nd living zone and ducted cooling is another bonus. All 3 bedrooms have built-in robes plus ceiling fans and are serviced by a central bathroom with separate toilet. A 2nd toilet has dual access between the laundry and outdoors. That's especially handy to the huge covered BBQ area, 6x9 metre shed and garage with rear roller door in a fully-fenced backyard with loads of room for extension (STCA). Near schools, Senior Citizens and Community Health Centre, it is perfectly placed for families, tradies, commuters and retirees from farming or other larger properties. As incentive for a brisk daily walk, it's only about 1 kilometre from Garlands Cafe and Bakehouse for brunch or dine-out at various eateries at the local shopping precinct where IGA, Aldi, banking, pharmacy and others meet many needs.","SOLD - $320,000","3

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,12 May Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Reap instant rewards or remain and rejoice
Situated to be particularly enticing to commuters, just off the Calder Highway, this property is also positioned to please shoppers. Being only one block from a major shopping centre and many big brand retail outlets such as Bunnings, it's also handy to buses into Bendigo as well as the local train station.
Encased in a timelessly attractive exterior, every room in this red brick residence has generous dimensions, even the laundry! So, you'll be amazed how spacious 130m2 can be with a clever floorplan. A dedicated sunroom, 2 living areas, huge kitchen, family sized bathroom and 3 bedrooms with built-in robes provide plenty of room for the average family.
The convenience of gas without the work of real wood, a gas log fire brings cosy country ambience to this suburban address. Together with ducted heating plus 5 ceiling fans, it supplies the utmost comfort to its occupants.
Recently cleaned and with solar system as well as new guttering installed, the roof and panels top off the residence without detracting from its classic facade. Replacing carpet and curtains would transform the interior, let alone any further refurbishment that can be done as time and budget permits.
A double tandem garage plus a large garden shed sit within a big fenced backyard where there is loads of room for extension (STCA). Ideal for tradies, investors, 1st home, to renovate and sell to reap instant rewards, or remain long term to fully rejoice in the fruits of your labour.","SOLD - $270,000","3

Offering great curb appeal with beautiful landscaping and an immaculate finish, you won’t want to leave this spacious home.
The Dennis Family build at Forest Fields Estate is less than five years old and in pristine condition. A separate shed next to the double garage is absolutely ideal for a buyer seeking extra storage for machinery or a caravan.

This spacious retreat also includes an ensuite with double shower, double vanity and separate toilet.
Access to the garage is on the left of the main entry, followed by a formal lounge. Past the master is the children’s wing with a separate toilet and powder room, large linen closet and a family bathroom with double access providing the practicalities of an ensuite to one of the three bedrooms – ideal for a guest suite. All three bedrooms feature built-in robes.
Finally, the hall opens into a large open plan living, kitchen and dining room and the dining space extends to a large games room. Behind the kitchen is a spacious laundry with plenty of storage and a glass sliding door providing access to the side of the home.
The stylish kitchen features a huge central island bench, large walk-in pantry, double fridge and microwave nook and modern fixtures and fittings.
Stacking glass sliders from both the living and dining space let in plenty of natural light and completely open up the corner of the home out to the al fresco beyond. This fantastic decked area is under the roofline and wraps around the rear of the house. A contemporary concrete table and chairs are perfectly built to suit the space and add to the contemporary feel.
Stunning landscaping includes paving down a ramp to the lawn area and an easement at the rear of the block features steps leading down to a vegetable patch. Trees providing a screen across the back of the block offer lots of privacy and the Gabion wall panels offer additional screening and zoning of the well-configured space.
Additional features include:
Ducted evaporative cooling and heating

Location is very important when considering buying a home and this three-bedroom home will appeal to many with a childcare centre, primary & secondary schools, shops, transport, sporting facilities, bushwalking tracks all within walking distance and the neighbourhood playground approximately 70 metres away. The home will suit a wide range of buyers from first home buyers right through to investors.
Stepping through the front door, to the left is the master bedroom complete with ceiling fan, walk in robe and ensuite with shower, vanity, toilet and heat lamps that help take the chill off those chilly mornings. To the right is the very comfortable lounge, overlooking the front garden and is a great space for the parents relax or watch TV as this zone can be separated from the rest of the home. Stepping down two steps, you enter the open plan kitchen/dining/living area. The very functional kitchen has plenty of bench space & cupboards, electric wall oven, gas cook top, all in very good order and enough room for a dining table and lounge in the adjacent meals/living area. There is a glass sliding door for access to the rear yard. The other two bedrooms have built in robes and are serviced by the family bathroom and a separate toilet. For climate control there is a gas wall furnace & a wall mounted air conditioner in the main living area plus a gas space heater and a large split system in the second living space at the front of the home.
Stepping outside is a paved sitting area, a great place to enjoy BBQ's or socialising with family and friends. The grassed backyard is large enough for the kids or pets to play, with low maintenance established gardens. For secure car accommodation, there is a double carport with roller doors plus the bonus of a 5m x 7m shed/workshop with concrete floor and power which can be easily accessed through gates at the side of the garage, perfect for storing an extra vehicle, trailer, mancave, etc.
A neat home on a 750Sqm block, in a family friendly neighbourhood, with all the amenities you could hope for nearby and only a 10-minute drive to the CBD of Bendigo. Call today to arrange an inspection.","SOLD - $315,000","3
