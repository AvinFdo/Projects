With all the features you have come to expect in a new home such as gas ducted heating, split system cooling and laminate timber flooring, you have a comfortable home for years to come. The numbers speak for themselves when you consider this home: at just over 12 months old you can still claim plenty of depreciation if you choose to invest, or claim the first home owners Grant if you choose to move in.
Why are so many people moving to Mandalay Beveridge? If not for the resort style living and facilities such as a swimming pool, gymnasium, restaurant and community centre, maybe it is for the award winning golf course? Maybe it is just for the lifestyle of community living within easy access to the Hume Freeway?
