kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,16 Arilpa Court Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"LIVE LIFE AT THE TOP
Taste, style and quality are the hallmark of this enviably situated, 5 year old home in Kangaroo Flat. Perched on the highest point of the Byambee Rises Estate, it brings with it breathtaking leafy views of iconic Bendigo and its surrounds.
On arrival, you are greeted with beautifully landscaped gardens made up of grass, rocks, and a selection of drought hardy plants – bare maintenance is required to keep it looking manicured. An extended concrete driveway provides access to the rear of the property, and allows the added bonus of extra vehicle parking. The double garage has a black concreted surface with built in storage cupboards and internal entrance. There is also a separate door to allow access to the backyard. Two stack stone feature balustrades on the front portico offer an inviting entrance. Once you walk through the double front doors, the craftsmanship and attention to detail is evident in every aspect of the build. To ensure there is balance, bold, clean lines and modern colours work in harmony with a home that feels calm, organised and inviting. The grand entrance introduces a stair case and two rooms – a theatre room to the left, with the inclusions of a projector / screen, and a fully wired surround sound system. The room presents warm, bold colours that attract the eye and has the ability to be closed off if necessary. To the right of the entrance is the guest wing. It includes a main bedroom, semi-ensuite and walk in robe. The carpet lined timber stair case, winds its way up to the second level where you are presented with three more bedrooms. The main bedroom opens out to the covered front balcony where you can enjoy spectacular views of the sunset. The main ensuite is remarkable. Crisp, white décor with charcoal timber grain finish cabinetry and floor to ceiling tiles. It holds a double shower, double vanity and an abundant amount of well-designed storage. A walk in robe completes this exquisite set-up. Two more bedrooms include a cleverly hidden walk in robe and both have access to the large back balcony. The second level also includes a large lounge area, walk in linen cupboard, 3 piece bathroom and separate toilet. The spacious kitchen boasts a large bench with a luxurious Caesar stone benchtop, cascading down the end to meet the ceramic tiled floor. The extended length of the countertop, allows for plenty of seating room to enjoy a casual breakfast bite. The open-plan design of this impressive space is ideal for the family that loves to cook and enjoy good food. The spacious, light-filled living and dining room features a gas log fire and opens out to a fabulous private outdoor entertaining precinct – which is where the fun begins. Step out from the kitchen area onto the expansive undercover pergola where you will find a built in BBQ with all the trimmings – including stainless steel benchtops, bar fridge, and sink. Designer, tropical inspired ceiling fans catch your eye, evoking a relaxed holiday style vibe. Adjoining this peaceful lounge area is a scintillating 10 x 4 in ground, self-cleaning, salt water swimming pool that is surrounded by glass fencing. On the adjacent side of the pool, the kids will discover a playground wonderland. Lush green grass surrounding an amazing raised cubby house that was built to replicate the main abode. This area of the property also includes a man cave like no other – a shed with tiled flooring, a separate entertaining area protected by a quality assembled shade sail, wood fire, and side driveway access where you could perhaps park a caravan or boat. Perhaps the most exclusive part of the backyard is the Pool House. The owners have many favourite features in the home, but the Pool House is a standout for them. It contains a bathroom, bar, entertainment system, refrigerated air conditioning, ceiling fans, lounge area and bi-fold doors that open up the pool house to the swimming pool.","SOLD - $930,000","4

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,14 Neil Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Beautifully renovated and on the Melbourne side of Bendigo
Unassuming is the facade of this surprise package. You just won't believe how beautiful this home is on the inside. Cream brick homes have a great reputation for being quality built and this one is no different but add to that a superb renovation to the interior and you're bound to be impressed. The current owners renovated the home with the thought of staying but, lucky for us, things change and they've decided to sell! Take advantage of this great opportunity to enjoy the fruits of their labour.
Not only are we on the Melbourne side of Bendigo but we're within walking distance of shops, schools, medical facilities, walking tracks, public transport including the Kangaroo Flat train station as well as being a only hop, skip and jump away from the newly completed Gurri Wanyarra Wellbeing Centre.
The list of features is extensive including:
- Polished hardwood floors in the living areas combined with crisp white walls and a few remaining features of the original home
- 2 x living areas. An open plan kitchen, dining and family space and another living room. Ideal for family living
- An attractive kitchen with concrete bench tops, soft close drawers and a 600mm stainless steel oven and gas cooktop
- An entertainer's dream, the home has two outdoor living areas. Both conveniently located off the kitchen dining area
- The main bedroom has a walk-in robe and stylish ensuite, bedrooms two and three have built-in robes
- The main bathroom is fresh and stylish with floor to ceiling tiled walls and is comprised of shower, vanity and bath
- A huge European style laundry is a great use of space. The size of this laundry could almost rival a standard one
- Climate control is catered for by way of ducted gas heating and ducted evaporative cooling
- A single carport with remote roller door access allows vehicle access to the backyard
- The backyard is very private and comes with two garden sheds, both with concrete floors
- The allotment is approximately 571m2 in total and very low maintenance

The spacious lounge room at the rear has lovely alfresco views, and has a clever study/office cupboard which is bigger than you think! At the front of the home is the dining/second living space complete with attractive timber floors. Completing the internal layout is the good sized laundry and second toilet, whilst ducted heating/cooling flows throughout and a 2kw solar panel system helps with the electricity bills!

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,4 Billiard Court Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Easy Care, Contemporary Family Home
This modern and spacious property is ready to become a family home. Located at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac and just minutes to the schools, supermarkets and services of Kangaroo Flat, this beautifully presented house is also less than 10 minutes drive to Maiden Gully. Built less than two years ago by Simmonds Homes, this pristine property ticks all the boxes for low-maintenance, contemporary family living.
The lovely light formal entry sets the scene for the rest of the home, with a stylish neutral finish and clean lines. To one side of the hall is a fabulous master bedroom. The spacious walk-in robe is tucked out of sight behind the bed and the ensuite is truly fabulous. With a walk-in shower, double vanity and separate toilet, this great space also includes a large freestanding bathtub and a glass sliding door opening out to a private deck at the side of the house. At the other end of the house, from a hallway leading off the kitchen, are the remaining three bedrooms. These all include a built-in robe and this end of the property also features a family bathroom, separate toilet and a laundry with access to the side of the home.
The main entry hallway also leads to two fantastic living spaces – a formal lounge and a theatre room – and then down to the third living area: a large open plan kitchen, dining and living room. The kitchen offers high-end fixtures and fittings, along with ample storage space including a walk-in pantry.
A glass sliding door from the dining area opens out to a fantastic alfresco space. This overlooks the neat and tidy backyard with built-in garden beds, lawn and a gravel path that leads to the front of the house and the double garage. Steps in the backyard also lead up to a sunny central courtyard, providing plenty of places in the yard to sit and relax. At the front of the property is additional vehicle parking with a second wide drive, ideal for a buyer looking to store a caravan, boat or trailer.
Additional features include:
- Ducted evaporative cooling and ducted heating throughout
- Modern high-end kitchen appliances including five-burner gas cooktop, 900mm oven and dishwasher
- Secure access from the double garage into the home
- Undercover alfresco with power and lighting
- Great off-street parking
- Access from both sides of the property to the rear garden
With everything beautifully finished, but also offering plenty of scope to make it your own, this lovely property provides space, contemporary design and an excellent family-friendly layout. Close to all amenities, less than 15 minutes to the centre of Bendigo and conveniently located on the Melbourne side of the city, this beautiful home has plenty to offer.","SOLD - $480,000","4
