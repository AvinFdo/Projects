Sitting on an impressive block of over 400m2 (approx) this corner block with a R.O.W at the rear has an impressive double fronted Victorian house in need of some TLC. This unique house has been divided into two separated spaces comprising of the main house at the front and a two bedroom unit at the rear.
Each dwelling has its own private access and courtyard allowing the option to either two rental incomes or an opportunity live in one while you rent the other out. You also have the ability to knockdown and develop (S.T.C.A).
The main residence is a great example of what some of the grand houses along Punt Road used to look like; featuring high ceilings with ornate pressed metal and grand marble mantles with OFP. The central hallway runs directly through the house giving access to each room which are ambiguously positioned allowing you to create a floor plan of your choosing. The roof and the kitchen have been replaced in recent years and is currently tenanted.
The location puts you in walking distance to The Alfred Hospital, Fawkner Park and Prahran Market. It also makes commuting by car very accessible and timely.","SOLD - $1,260,000","6

south-yarra-vic-3141,11/39-41 Kensington Road South Yarra VIC 3141,"Castle Hill - Exquisite Grandeur, Exclusively Positioned
With an air of majesty and a regal resonance, this superbly renovated and wonderfully character-filled, two bedroom apartment delivers an exquisite juxtaposition of the traditional and the contemporary. Part of the tightly-held, 1940 constructed, 'Castle Hill' building, crafted by Arthur Plaisted, in the style of the Georgian era, the home is tastefully set towards the rear of immaculately manicured gardens to evoke a surreal sense of old world escape. Accessed securely via an entry that is shared with only one other, a terrazzo staircase with timber and wrought iron ballistrad leads to the first floor where the apartment's towering ceilings and polished timber floors create an immediate visual impact. SMEG-equipped with stone benches, the kitchen is removed from the generous dining room and semi-attached lounge with an attractive balcony that oversees the gardens. The bedrooms are genuinely large with substantial built-in robes, whilst the renovated bathroom / laundry is a pristine example of timeless designer flair in this home that also features hydronic heating, reverse cycle air conditioning and undercover parking. Within walking distance of Toorak Rd and mere moments from both Chapel St and Toorak Village, this is a highly-coveted location that delivers enviable proximity to a near-endless selection of wonderful cafes, restaurants and bars, as well as the Como Centre, cinemas, the iconic Number 8 tram, trains from South Yarra Station and wonderful shopping everywhere.","SOLD - $1,055,000","2
