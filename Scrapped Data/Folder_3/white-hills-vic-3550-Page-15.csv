white-hills-vic-3550,54 Scott Street White Hills VIC 3550,"PERIOD HOME WITH AMAZING SPACES
This might look like a sweet Victorian period-style home from the street but inside it has been extended and enhanced to create a spacious five-bedroom family home with multiple living areas.
The woven wire fence, oak trees, pretty garden and picture-perfect white facade are indicative of more charming features found inside.
Under the bull-nosed verandah, the high-waisted front door with lead-light sidelights opens to a traditional centre hallway with high, timber lined ceilings and timber fretwork.
Off the hall, the front sitting room includes an open fireplace with timber surround and mantlepiece. It is followed by two bedrooms, both with built-in robes, and a large lounge room before the hallway opens into a vestibule/sunroom with access to the bathroom, laundry and a third bedroom.
Large, remodelled country-style kitchen includes timber-lined ceiling, brick fireplace with IXL wood stove, gas cooker, dishwasher, ceiling fan and ample cabinetry. Cork-look floor tiles flow through to adjoining spacious family room with split system air conditioner, under-stair storage and double sliding doors to external pergolas for outdoor living.
A side entrance from the return verandah opens to the lounge room where a staircase leads to two first floor bedrooms, both with robes and leafy garden outlooks.
The block measures over 2000 square metres (approximately Â½ acre) with a convenient second frontage to Kennewell Street, 6m x 9m shed, garden shed, fruit trees and good Colorbond fencing.
The setting is like a little piece of the country in suburbia with lots of open space and the White Hills Football and Netball grounds opposite with the beautiful Bendigo Botanical Gardens, schools, local pub and public transport within easy walking distance.","SOLD - $386,605","5

white-hills-vic-3550,29 Waratah Street White Hills VIC 3550,"Neat home and a huge block
This 1980’s brick home sits on an enormous 2,655 m2 (approx.) block in two allotments. Zoned general residential, there is certainly potential in its current 2 lot configuration however a variety of options are at your disposal, given the easement within Lot 2 and all STCA of course. Alternatively, you may just wish to have a solid home on a huge block!
The neutral colour palette and new carpeting allows potential purchasers to either move straight in or add this low maintenance property to their investment portfolio.
The entrance hall leads immediately into the large living-dining area with decorative cornicing and a free standing solid fuel heater. The highly functional kitchen flows directly off the dining area and includes a double sink and new upright Chef gas cooker.
The three bedrooms, all with built in robes, are located to the rear of the property off a central hallway. The hallway can be closed off from the living zone to minimise noise to the bedrooms at night. The bedrooms are serviced by a large family bathroom with bath, shower, vanity and toilet. For convenience, a separate toilet is also provided off the laundry.
The block includes a double carport and large 6m x 6m shed with concrete floor and power. A smaller 3m x 3m garden shed provides additional storage options.
Located in walking distance to Weeroona Secondary College and Lake Weeroona and only a short drive to the Bendigo CBD, White Hills shops and the new Village Epsom. This is an opportunity not to be missed.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"3
