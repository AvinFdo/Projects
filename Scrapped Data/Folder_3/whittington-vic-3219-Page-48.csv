Corner block, approximately 673 square metres of prime land in the heart of Newcomb, substantial shedding and with smoke and fire damage in 3 rooms this one is definitely not for the faint of heart. Viewing this property is a must as there is so much potential on offer to the right buyer with the home currently comprising of 3 bedrooms, separate living and dining room and a timber kitchen plus a bathroom that has been partially renovated.
Facing Wilsons Rd. but with side access also from Adzar Rd. this flat parcel of land is ripe for subdivision (S.T.C.A.) and with Newcomb shopping Ccentre, schools, local shops and medical facilities located close by the demand for townhouses in the area has never been greater making this a very attractive proposition.
Unaffected by the fire, the massive 6 car garage with storage space and workshop is ideal for tradesmen or those that love to tinker in the garage and is a great place to start with the rebuilding of the home if that's the plan.
This very rare opportunity is certainly not for everyone but those that can see the value and are up for the challenge should certainly jump at the chance to buy in ever popular Newcomb.
