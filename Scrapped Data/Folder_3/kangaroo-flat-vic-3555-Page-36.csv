kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,31 Lukin Crescent Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Liberty to Live Life to the Fullest
Seize the day! Sell your mower and purchase this terrific townhouse, liberating all that time spent on garden toil to start ticking off your bucket list. The ultimate in minimal maintenance, this is the ideal property to lock and leave for extended vacations. Therefore, investors, busy people working long hours and first home owners will also find that it has plenty to offer.
Situated in a well-settled area amongst other house-proud owners, it stands alone on its own title. An elevated position grants great views of tree-topped hills on the horizon to those enjoying a glass of wine or a cuppa, catching a cool summer breeze on the front verandah.
Generous open plan living has gas heating, reverse cycle air conditioning and ceiling fan to ensure constant comfort. Plenty of storage has been built-in, such as floor-to-ceiling robes in both bedrooms and loads of kitchen cabinetry where an abundance of bench surrounds a gas stove.
Extending the floorplan, a substantial undercover alfresco area is semi-enclosed by timber screens and cafe blinds creating a cosy, sheltered and private room. The single garage has the convenience of a remote-controlled roller door plus space for a workbench.
Close to bus stops for Bendigo and local shopping complex, it's just 5 minute walk to primary school and secondary college. Only 3 minute drive or 20 minute walk to a health centre and shopping precinct, it's not much more to catch a train to Melbourne and only 150 kilometres to the big smoke via the Calder Highway.
