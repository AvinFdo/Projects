kennington-vic-3550,25 Arms Street Long Gully VIC 3550,"'Arms Cottage'
Meticulously renovated and restored to infuse its original beauty with timeless class. Wide Victorian hallway with radiant chandeliers, three large bedrooms all with BIR'S and polished floorboards, main with working fireplace. Formal lounge with open fire place and exquisite mantle and PFB's. Sparkling fully equipped kitchen, Bosch D/W and gas cooking. Stunning 4-piece bathroom including free standing bath. The second living/ dining room leads out to brick paved outdoor space plus a great sized landscaped yard with large garden shed and raised vegetable and herb beds. The side drive allows enough space for caravan or extra car spaces. Extras include ducted gas heating, evap. cooling, restumped, rewired and re insulated.
The home (Arms Cottage) was run as a successful Airbnb for approx. 18 months prior to final renovations being completed.
The property has two titles and is set on a total of 817 sq. By realigning the boundary (STCA), the home would be on 517 sq.m and the vacant block 300 sq. m. The current owners have plans available (not approved) for a home to compliment the surrounding heritage neighborhood. Other ideas would be maybe a shed, pool or granny flat (STCA).
A little bit of history: Originally 2 side by side Victorian Terraces built in 1878. In 1899 a fire broke out in the left side Terrace and even though the neighbors came with buckets and tried to put it out the home was destroyed. In 1920 the terrace was replaced with a Cal Bungalow. This is the reason why the windows at the front of the house are not identical.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"3

kennington-vic-3550,9A Niemann St Bendigo VIC 3550,"More than meets the eye
If you're looking for a unique, low maintenance home or investment, look no further than 9A Niemann Street, right in central Bendigo!
Located in a small cul-de-sac, on a compact 262m2 (approx.) block on its own title and set on the edges of the hospital precinct sits 23 squares of living over 2 storeys that is 9A Niemann Street, Bendigo. An independently built, great find for the downsizers, first home buyers, entertainers and investors alike.
Though this property may seem small upon first glance, this is a classic case of looks can be deceiving'.
Entering the property at the naturally lit top floor, you are met with an inviting hallway, leading directly into the vast open kitchen/living/dining space. The kitchen is a great spot for the home cook or entertainer. It comprises of stone bench top, modern European appliances, dishwasher and ample storage spaces, as well as a low maintenance, mod wood decking space that opens up the entire first floor to the outside and views to the Bendigo CBD.
To the right you will find the master bedroom. A very well sized room with reverse cycle air conditioning, that lends itself to more gorgeous natural lighting and an en-suite with spa bath and huge shower.
To view the rest of the home, you must head downstairs. At the bottom of the stairs you come straight into the second living room. From here, through to the hallway, you will find the remaining 2 well sized bedrooms. All naturally cool and ceiling fans in each.
Built in 2011, this property is incredibly low maintenance with native gardens and is brick veneer, but also North facing with clerestory windows, and electric solar power and hot water system, and ground floor water tasks all adding to the energy efficiency rating of 6 Stars. With gas heating and air conditioning throughout you will stay comfortable all year round.
