NB: All inspections will now be conducted as a one-on-one private session, coupled with the appropriate safeguards as recommended by health authorities (increased sanitation and social distancing).
Ideally situated so that every South Yarra attraction is within quick, convenient reach, this inviting Victorian has been intelligently renovated to offer dual living domains below two modern upstairs bedrooms surrounding a central bathroom. A terrace façade that conveys traditional period character creates a great introduction to downstairs spaces including welcoming living and dining rooms that are linked yet distinct and complemented by open fire-places. To the rear, the modern mood of the second living area is matched an open-plan kitchen featuring broad benchspace while beyond, a courtyard offers the significant inner city advantage of off street parking. Well maintained, entirely comfortable current day proportions offering straightforward scope for a contemporary update when so desired in a location destined to be always in demand close to Chapel Street, the Jam Factory complex and Grosvenor Street Reserve.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"3
