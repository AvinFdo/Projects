white-hills-vic-3550,5 Meggs Court California Gully VIC 3556,"And... Action
Here is an affordable home or investment property in a location that will encourage your family or tenants to lead an active lifestyle. A lifestyle out enjoying all of the nearby infrastructure and recreational activities on offer.
The beautiful Jobs Gully Bushland Reserve divides Jobs Gully Road and Oswald Street and is where the suburbs of Eaglehawk and California Gully meet. Meggs Court sits between Bright Street and Truscott Avenue and the property is positioned at the end of the cul-de-sac. Bright Street Park and play space are accessible at the end of the Court and this also provides a ""short cut"" to the bus stops along Bright Street.
Eaglehawk Secondary College is only short walking distance from the property and it's only a short drive to nearby primary schools, Champions IGA, Bendigo District RSL, Neangar Park Golf Club and the Sandhurst Road Milk Bar. As well as many other attractions including Truscott Reserve and play space and Long Gully Splash Park. It's a ten minute drive to the Bendigo CBD and just five minutes to Eaglehawk which provides great access to Aldi and IGA supermarkets, shopping village, Star Cinema, restaurants, cafes, bakery, banks and the train station.
Such close access to Eaglehawk also provides you or your tenants with the health and wellness benefits of Peter Krenz Leisure Centre which offers a gym, pools, steam room and spa. You'll no doubt visit Lake Neangar often to enjoy the space and equipment for adventure and movement play, as well as the picnic and BBQ facilities. Many a day will also be happily spent in and around the Botanical Gardens, sports precinct, McKern Skate Park and along the Mulga Bill Bike Trail.
As well as this property offering an active lifestyle, it calls you to act quickly to secure it ahead of other buyers. Measuring approximately 713m2 it offers plenty of off street parking under carport areas, which double as space for outdoor undercover living, meals and entertaining. The shed provides plenty of space for a workshop in addition to storage and there are plenty of grassy areas behind gates for supervised play and to keep pets. The three bedroom home also provides you with the opportunity to value add. For example it would be smart to fit robes to bedrooms two and three and give the property some cosmetic modern updates and a touch of your style.

white-hills-vic-3550,54 Stoney Gum Lane Lockwood VIC 3551,"House, Self Contained Unit & 3 Sheds on 3.5Ac
It's always a pleasure to return to a property to see what past clients have created once they have renovated and put their stamp on a place. To say that what I saw when I recently returned to 54 Stoney Gum Lane was ""pleasing"" would be a total understatement. The place is utterly transformed! How lucky the property was to land in the hands of a skilled carpenter when it was last sold. It's only that a job opportunity interstate has arisen, that this family will part with the property so soon after the completion of the renovation works.
This provides you with an opportunity to secure this beautiful 3.5 acre property and enviable country lifestyle. Here you'll enjoy the convenience of being located just as short 5 minute drive to Kangaroo Flat and 10 minutes to central Bendigo. As well as the privacy, serenity and health and wellness benefits of this perfect position, adjacent to the Lockwood South State Forest.
The house has been redesigned to maximise enjoyment of the stunning natural environment here. For example the new stacking doors to the lounge and open plan dining area lets in birdsong, sunlight and warmth, refreshing breezes and leafy green views as you desire. The three bedrooms are generously big and there is now an abundance of storage with brilliant cabinetry in the laundry, fitted robes to bedroom two and three and a walk in robe to the main. While the kitchen provides a walk in pantry and heaps of clever cabinetry. The parquetry floor in the kitchen was a labour of love for the carpenter owner. The front north facing deck and rear verandah dress and finish the home perfectly. The modern neutral decor, brand new carpets, paint, window furnishings and lighting all emphasise the perfect homely feel here.
Extensive shedding includes a 6 x 9m shed, a 5.5 x 7m workshop with a 3 x 7m carport and a 3 x 5.5m storage shed.
Your young adult will love the self contained unit - though may never want to move out of home! It's very, very cool! With keypad entry, marble look tile floor, skylight and LED lighting, lounge area, kitchenette and bedroom space it's truly a home in itself! What appear to be extensive robes near the bed in fact are. Oh, except for the middle doors which lead into a private ensuite!
