kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,33 Pattison Drive Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Love Me Do
In a competitive market such as this it's really hard to not be disheartened when a property you love is secured by someone else ahead of you. You're likely experiencing a pressure to find and secure a property before others see it? To protect ourselves against the hurt of missing out, we try not to fall in love with a property too soon.
But we're human and well presented properties make it all the harder to keep a level head. The title for this ad points to the Beatles debut single about loyalty. Whether this is your debut into the property market as a first home buyer, you're seeking an investment property, or you desire a home for retirement; you'll quickly feel that this home will serve you incredibly well. It calls you to love it.
Its beauty is first evident in its street appeal - the neat landscaped gardens, front bay windows and attractive brick veneer construction. Inside the home reveals deeper appeal including fastidiously maintained carpets and paintwork, modern vinyl plank flooring, ceiling fans throughout, ducted evaporative cooling, split system heating and cooling and a gas heater.
The three robed bedrooms are well proportioned, there are two living areas (the second of which provides the possibility of a renovation to achieve a fourth bedroom if desired) and an ensuite. The kitchen and meals area flows beautifully to the covered outdoor entertainment area and a sunny paved area to the rear. The manageable lawn areas and neat gardens are very private and peaceful. Fruit trees include olive, nectarine, plum and apple. There is a compost area, veggie gardens and two garden sheds.
The immediate neighbourhood offers access for bushwalks, there are bus stops and a playground along Queen Street and the position here is just a short drive to the numerous offerings of Kangaroo Flat including Lansell Square, schools, medical facilities, the Kangaroo Flat Railway Station and very popular Gurri Wanyarra Wellbeing Centre.
This is a property you'll love and one that will very likely love you back with lifestyle benefits and capital gains.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"3

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,15 Alder Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Modern Living, Space and Location.
Modern living, space and location, good things also come in threes.
Welcome home to 15 Alder Street, a three-bedroom charmer conveniently located off High Street and nestled on a generous 934m2 block.
The 1950s cream brick abode has been beautifully refurbished throughout and offers plenty of space for the whole family with two additional versatile rooms; a study/nursery and detached studio.
Walking along the timber decked front patio and inside the front entry you're greeted by the open plan kitchen, living and meals area which beautifully combines the modern vibe with the home's original charm.
A cosy gas wood fireplace with mantle, stunning polished timber flooring and plenty of natural light sets the scene for the home's inviting nature.
The sleek gourmet kitchen is a standout with its abundance of modern cabinetry, subway tiling and 900mm Westinghouse freestanding oven.
Each bedroom is unique in design, offering either a built-in or walk-in robe, generous space, a warming colour palette and is serviced by the home's main bathroom offering all the essentials.
Outside is where the home continues to shine with the large secure backyard boasting an undercover and paved entertaining patio with barbeque area, the studio which could also be used as a teenagers' retreat and a large concreted and powered shed with mechanics pit.
Off street parking is a breeze; either park in the driveway, under the carport with its electric roller door, or take the car all the way through to the backyard.
With its large allotment, utilise the space for yourself or invest now and plan for the future with potential for subdivision (STCA).
Central to both Kangaroo Flat shops in one direction and Bendigo CBD the other, the location is a standout. Arrange your inspection today with Jesse Forbes.","SOLD - $402,500","3
