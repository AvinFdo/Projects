kennington-vic-3550,1/1 Fiona Place Kennington VIC 3550,"POSITION, POSITION - INVEST OR NEST!!
Situated within walking distance to Strath Hill & Strath Village shopping centers, La Trobe uni, primary schools, doctors etc., this pristine home is all set to move in to or rent out. The single garage has been converted into a 2nd living area or 3rd bedroom, but could be easily reverted back to it's original use if garaging is a priority. There are built-in-robes in the dedicated two bedrooms, with a three piece 2-way bathroom off the main bedroom. A gas wall furnace and a reverse cycle unit are more than adequate to ensure a comfy internal environment. Sited on a neat, compact block of about 480m2, there's still room for the kiddies to play and features an attractive garden, which would be easily maintained. Expected rental of $280 to $300 per week.","SOLD - $271,500","3

kennington-vic-3550,7 Primrose Court KENNINGTON VIC 3550,"Picturesque Views Across Kennington
With entertaining options galore, including an inviting solar heated in-ground pool, and surprising views, this immaculately presented abode has it all.
Set well back from the street on an elevated site the house has an impressive minimal maintenance frontage of beautifully manicured shrubs, encircled by neat brick edges and surrounded by a stone landscape.
The front door is through a lovely brick-paved courtyard fernery; just one of many relaxation options.
Inside, an L-shape hallway has three bedrooms off it along one side.
Ducted floor heating, a reverse-cycle split-system and ceiling fans throughout temper the climate at all times.
There are plenty of storage options as well including linen, laundry and living room storage.
Two bedrooms have two-door built-in wardrobes while the main has a three-door arrangement and a three-piece en suite with a separate shower.
To service the other bedrooms there's a family bathroom with a separate shower and bath and featuring a box-bay window overlooking a fernery.
Also off the hallway is a large formal lounge and dining area with a brick arch leading through to a spacious kitchen, dining and second living zone.
The kitchen has all you need: electric wall oven and hotplate, a dishwasher, a long work bench and great storage including two by two-door built-in pantries.
A sliding door opens to a brick-paved alfresco area overlooking the pool (which has a new pump) and wonderful tree-top views.
Lawn and flower beds surround the house and a garden sprinkler system eliminates the need to water. There's also a garden shed.
The double garage has a lock-up roller door and backyard access.
Kennington Reservoir offers morning or evening jaunts, schools and a uni are close and you'll never tire of the shopping choices at Strath Village, Kennington Village and Strath Hill shopping centres, all an easy walk.","SOLD - $375,000","3

kennington-vic-3550,15 Clarence Avenue KENNINGTON VIC 3550,"A Classic on Clarence
Set on a quiet tree-lined street, this two-bedroom home in original condition has loads of charm & charisma, with the potential to renovate to three.
Close to all amenities including Kennington Primary School, La Trobe University, and shopping centres, it's ideal for first-home buyers, a professional couple or retirees. A one-roomed bungalow in the backyard is a bonus.
Shade trees dot the front garden, there are two entrances from the concrete patio: a single door and french doors that open into a hallway. We entered via the single door. The care that's been shown this one-owner home over the years is clearly evident.
On the left is a delightfully inviting lounge room with a lovely ambience. The slate fireplace, with a gas heater set into it, is definitely the highlight. Deep cornices and picture rails are other features. There's also a wall-mounted air-conditioner and ceiling fan.
Sliding glass doors open to reveal an adjoining dining room while through another sliding door is the bright and cheerful kitchen. There are no high-tech appliances here, but an upright electric stove serves the owner well as does above- and underbench storage. And again, the ambience.
Two bedrooms with built-in wardrobes and a three-piece bathroom, with a deep bath and separate shower, are towards the front of the home. The main bedroom has a reverse-cycle split-system, ceiling fan and corner windows overlooking the front garden.
From the kitchen, a door with a quirky porthole window opens to a small vestibule with a laundry.
A vine-covered verandah is your introduction to the split-level backyard where you can plant vegies, and enjoy the serenity.
This home is a classic, so don't procrastinate!","SOLD - $266,000","2
