kennington-vic-3550,159 Condon Street Kennington VIC 3550,"Enviably situated and beautifully maintained
This beautifully maintained rendered brick home offers character, quality and comfort in a very central Strathdale location. This quality build was part of a unique birchgrove development which has lost none of its modern appeal. The property has its own street frontage with double garage for off-street parking and dual entry for added security.
The landscaped front and rear gardens feature low maintenance synthetic turf paired with established plantings of mature trees, hedges and rose varieties. The front rendered facade features roller shutters on all road facing south windows and awnings for increased comfort during the summer months to the rear.
The entrance hall introduces the generous master suite to the right then opens into the main living / dining / kitchen area. The main bedroom features a walk in robe, TV point and ensuite with double shower, double width vanity and toilet complementing two additional double bedrooms. The neutral décor flows harmoniously throughout the home; providing a blank canvas for new owners or investors to make their mark.
The design of the open plan living zone is deceptively simple with the dining area adjacent to the kitchen and living room linked to the private west-facing paved pergola through a large sliding glass door. The extensive cabinetry of the G shaped kitchen maintains clean modern lines providing multiple storage options and ample bench space. It features a cleverly hidden double width appliance cabinet, large pantry, LG dishwasher, double sink, Blanco electric oven and Fisher & Paykel gas stove top.
A central hall leads off the living room to the two double bedrooms with built in robes. These are serviced by a three piece bathroom with shower, vanity, bath and separate toilet. A functional and well-equipped laundry with external yard access is located at the end of the hall. The double garage with automatic roller door also includes direct access to the rear yard, a handy bonus for garden maintenance.
Outside the garden has been lovingly cultivated providing a secluded spot in which to relax and enjoy the fruits of your labour. The rear yard overlooks a serene common garden reserve complete with ornamental plants and water feature.
Further features of the property include:
• Ducted gas heating and ducted evaporative cooling
• Ceiling fans in all bedrooms
• Gas hot water system
Enviably situated in walking distance to Kennington Reservoir and the new Kennington Village with public transport literally on your doorstep. This classic home provides a secure investment both now and into the future.","SOLD - $440,000","3

Look no further than this perfectly presented, rendered, three bedroom brick home in the heart of Kennington. As soon as you enter you will know that you have found your dream home. The lovely Otway Messmate timber floor flows freely throughout exuding a lovely honey coloured glow. There is nothing to do but move in. Located centrally in the home, the kitchen with an abundance of bench and cupboard space overlooks the large dining area which can easily accommodate a large family or be the entertaining hub when guests come over. The separate lounge room is conveniently accessed from this central zone also. There are 3 generous sized bedrooms which all have ceiling fans and built in robes to ease any storage needs. A bright and airy bathroom will be the envy of all your friends. Year round comfort is maintained with both ducted gas heating and ducted evaporative cooling ensuring every month is a holiday. Stepping outside, you will want to live all year round on the timber decked covered entertaining area that encases an electric heated spa plus outdoor kitchen to die for with both hot and cold water connected. Outdoor blinds will keep the cool breezes at bay and provide added privacy while sipping champagne in your private spa area. With accommodation for in excess of 4 vehicles, the tradie will love the shed / workshop that has a wood fire also. Both children and pets will love the yard which has a separate area behind the shed which can be used as a vegetable patch or dog run no matter which your family requires.
