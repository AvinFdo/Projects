white-hills-vic-3550,390 Napier Street White Hills VIC 3550,"HUGE 1293m2 BLOCK, BIG POTENTIAL!
If opportunity knocks only once, then you will not want to pass up on this prime piece of Bendigo real estate! Whether you are searching for business or personal gain, the potential is obvious! And, with some astute thinking and clever foresight, you just might be the lucky buyer to unleash it!
Located in close proximity to Lake Weeroona, Weeroona College and only a short drive to the Bendigo CBD, the property has a plethora of possible suiters. Set on a huge 1293m2 (approx.) allotment with approximately 20 metres frontage, the property will provide maximum exposure and is ideally converted to a medical practice, dentist surgery, chiropractor, home business or other commercial entity
The existing double fronted cream brick residence is attractive from the road and certainly worthy of a new lease of life! Renovate and/or extend for personal or business reasons, or potentially demolish and develop the block (STCA), the choice is yours to make! In mostly original order, the floor plan is liveable for the now but will benefit from a renovation in the near future. Its current configuration boasts three carpeted bedrooms (or consulting rooms), large open plan kitchen and lounge area (ideal for a reception/waiting room area), three piece bathroom and separate laundry at the rear.
Outside, the 1293m2 (approx.) allotment is a blank canvas ready for your ideas. There is an existing lock up garage/workshop providing undercover car parking, and some sundry shedding/carports at the rear. If your purpose is business orientated, there is loads of room for a car park suitable for 15 or more cars or more shedding. For personal use, the possibilities for a fabulous yard and garden are endless!
A rare opportunity to purchase a raw slice of your personal or professional future. Currently leased at $295 per week, the property is earning an income in the interim whilst you decide what to do in the future!","SOLD - $355,000","3

white-hills-vic-3550,9 Sharyn Street White Hills VIC 3550,"Walk to the White Hills Primary School
The first thing you notice about this home is the location, it's hidden down a quiet Street that features privacy and peacefulness. Located close to everything that the White Hills area has to offer, this 4 bedroom property is perfect for a growing family, being a short walk to White Hills Primary School, the shopping strip, the White Hills oval, Botanic garden and swimming pool.
Built solid, this 4 bedroom home offers so much to so many. Large, open and generous living and dining spaces. The main living and dining area is open plan and large enough for an oversized couch set, large dining room table and will setup the home beautifully. The second living is perfect for a cinema room or children's hideaway. The home features central heating and cooling throughout the property.
The Master bedroom with ensuite and dual built in cupboards offers privacy and a great area to get away from it all, while the 3 other bedrooms are a mix of sizes, one with outdoor access, making it potentially perfect for the short stay accommodation market.
The kitchen is well placed within the home to provide both a practical and connected element to the property. Featuring a gas bench top stove, electric oven and dishwasher, Walk in Pantry, plenty of cupboard space and a breakfast bar, this light filled kitchen has plenty of family meals left in it yet, or could be given an update easily.
The main bathroom includes both a shower and a bath, vanity, mirror and separately located toilet. It's easy to see a buyer living in the house as is or extracting more value from it by updating the kitchen and bathroom over time.
With so many features, it's difficult to mention them all, but keep in mind that this property also includes a good sized study with plenty of space for dual desks, single carport with attached double lockup garage, a large sized backyard that is perfect for green thumb, water tank, separate shed, and a back veranda suited to large family or friend gatherings with an outdoor 5 person spa already at the property.
If you are a first home buyer, a growing family looking for more room, an investor or short stay accommodation newbie or expert, then this is the property for you to check out. You might be overwhelmed by everything it has to offer, but you won't be left disappointed.","SOLD - $312,500","4
