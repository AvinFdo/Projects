white-hills-vic-3550,16 Bosquet Street White Hills VIC 3550,"Potential Plus..!!
Overlooking the proposed Botanical Garden Development and a short walk to White Hills Shops and White Hills Primary School is this rare gem that is sure to appeal to savvy investor, owner occupier and developers alike. While the home itself is in need of work, the opportunity and potential cannot be denied. The land measures approximately 836m2 and features a 3 bedroom home, oversized pergola plus a 6mx9m shed and skillion. The home would respond well to renovation while the development potential of the block should be explored given its perfect location. A quiet part of town yet only minutes to the Bendigo CBD, Lake Weeroona and with the prospect of adjoining the Botanical Gardens this property is a must see!","SOLD - $198,000","3

white-hills-vic-3550,15 Hamelin Street WHITE HILLS VIC 3550,"HEART WARMING FORTIES VINTAGE
Lovers of all things retro will appreciate this classic home built in the mid forties. Fashionable and prestigious for its time, it would have been worthy of a place on the pages of the Australian Home Beautiful magazine back then. The solid-brick construction retains many distinguishing features of its era including wide entry hall with high, ornate ceilings, double-hung sash windows, polished hardwood ­floors, quaint timber servery doors and cabinetry between kitchen and dining room and a feature tapestry-brick replace surround with timber mantel and ­flanked by display cabinets finished with etched glass doors on either side in the lounge room. Three large and light bedrooms all have built-in robes while the bathroom has recently had a stunning vintage-themed makeover. It's all glossy black-and white tiles with a frameless shower screen, wc and retro pedestal hand basin. The remodeled timber kitchen is equipped with gas hotplates, electric wall oven, breakfast bar and ample cabinetry. Modern comforts include gas log-fire in the lounge, ducted heating and two split system units. Outside a very private covered, paved full length entertainment area overlooks a lush fernery and
lawn area for the kids to play in the secure back yard. Sited on corner allotment of about 693 square metres with twin garages with auto doors accessed from both streets. Located opposite the Bendigo Botanical Gardens and walking distance to preschool centre, schools and public transport. A classic and heart warming home for retro types.

white-hills-vic-3550,47 Raglan Street WHITE HILLS VIC 3550,"Victorian Gem in Popular White Hills
This lovely Victorian home has been held within the same family for the past 45 years, and has finally come up for sale.
Evident as you walk through the front gate, character and charm is in abundance.
The bull-nose front verandah with ornate lace-work leads you through the front door to the central hallway, which runs the length of the home.
In keeping with the era of the home decorative ceilings, walls and polished floorboards are a feature.
The 3 large bedrooms all have ceiling fans, the main bedroom also has a built in robe, and ceiling fans can also be found in the lounge and kitchen.
The formal lounge is massive with a central fire place and split system air-conditioning, while the modern kitchen includes gas cooking.
The back verandah looks onto a lush, eclectic garden that blends gracefully into the tapestry of foliage that so characterises this leafy area.
With water tanks, a vegetable patch and established fruit trees, the yard concludes in a double carport and 7m x 6m shed, both readily accessible via the convenient driveway that runs the length of this 1073m2 block.
This home will suit a family or anyone looking for a suburban sanctuary with space to live and breathe.
Plenty of room for a pool (STCA) or possible subdivision potential (STCA).
Just a 2 minute walk from the nearest school, with shops, public transport, kinder, and the extended Botanical Gardens all less than 5 minutes on foot.
An inspection will impress.

white-hills-vic-3550,250 Heinz Street WHITE HILLS VIC 3550,"'MYRNIONG'
What an amazing lifestyle property!In the same hands for approximately 7 decades, situated less than 10 minutes from the heart of the city and offering 75 acres of privacy, peace and quiet with great access to the Wellsford forest, an abundance of native trees plus a large dam with a seasonal creek and excellent catchment.
This unique property has a substantial brick home that was built a little over 65 years ago and offers 4 bedrooms plus an L shaped lounge and dining room. Last farmed in 1983 the property is now regenerating naturally and with a little help from the current owners.
The final word - our vendor has previously written - "" The peace of mind from living in the bush provides a lifestyle that the majority of mankind miss""
