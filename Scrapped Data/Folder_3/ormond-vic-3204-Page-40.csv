Make a premier College Zone address your Mission! Proximity to leading schools, including McKinnon College, makes this period residence so desirable. On 680sqm approx this 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom light-filled Spanish Mission home is a rare find in the area.

With a secure garage in lush tank-watered surrounds, this gracious residence combines rich period detail (including story-book leadlight windows, elaborate ceilings & fireplaces) with modern comforts ...and one of the area's most family-wise addresses.
