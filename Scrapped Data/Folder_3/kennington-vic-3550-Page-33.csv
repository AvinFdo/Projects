kennington-vic-3550,23 Mafeking Street South KENNINGTON VIC 3550,"SOUGHT AFTER CREAM BRICKER IN KENNINGTON
This elevated solid cream brick home in a well sought after area has lots to offer. In original condition it is structurally sound and has a great floor plan. The lounge dining area is huge with large windows and offering a connecting balcony out to the front of the home. This era home rarely offers 2 bathrooms as the main bedroom contains the bonus of a connecting ensuite. There are 3 bedrooms in total and generous side access to the rear yard and handy to nearby bus stop. Needing some cosmetic renovation this home is well worth inspecting.

kennington-vic-3550,1/225 St Aidans Road KENNINGTON VIC 3550,"KENNINGTON SHINES
This stand alone Solid Brick unit has so many delightful features; inside and out
From the front entry into the lounge you are able to appreciate the spaciousness of the rooms, dining and kitchen with open plan from the lounge.
Lovely east facing window in the lounge that lets in the early morning sun, just before you take a stroll around the Kennington Lake.
Two large bedrooms with Built in robes, good bathroom with the advantage of having a separate bath, shower and vanity.
Very private rear garden with access to shed and single carport which is entranced off Strathdale Crescent
We are so lucky to have this unit for sale as the presentation by the current tenant is First Class;she has been here for a very long time and loves the unit as if it were her own.
For investment purposes this unit stands out, for quality, spaciousness and very convenient position for future gain and long term tenancy.
Walk around the lovely surrounds of the Kennington Reserve, enjoy the local sporting facilities, the shopping, the school.....and then there's a bus stop across the road.
