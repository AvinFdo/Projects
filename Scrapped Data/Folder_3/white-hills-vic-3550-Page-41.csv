Ideally located just minutes from the heart of the city and walking distance to train station, sporting reserve and bike track, is this immaculate and fully renovated character home. The high-end quality finish offers the very best of modern living, whilst retaining many original features that provide a charming feel to the space.
The neat façade offers both steps and a ramp up to the front porch. Set back from the road, the home features a sense of peace and quiet as soon as you step indoors. Beyond the front entry is a large open plan kitchen, living and dining room. A carpeted lounge area provides a cosy feel, and quality timber flooring through the rest of the living space perfectly suits the style of the home. To one side of the entry is a second, formal, living space that is light and bright thanks to dual aspect windows and would also serve as a fantastic home office. The brand-new kitchen makes use of the original floorplan, including the stove space, and features ample storage.
A hallway leads down towards the rear of the home and opens into all three bedrooms, each of which is generously proportioned and offers ceiling fans and built-in robes. The master bedroom enjoys extra storage, along with a modern ensuite with double vanity, and a gas log fireplace surrounded by a timber mantle. The remaining two bedrooms are serviced by a large and light family bathroom with stone benchtop, double vanity and luxurious stone freestanding bathtub. A separate toilet, and a modern and bright laundry at the rear of the home complete the floorplan.
Outdoors, a sunny deck is perfect for outdoor living, and this overlooks a low-maintenance lawn area. Garden beds run along the fence line of all four sides of the property and, at the rear, the high fence offers security and privacy. A large garden shed is the perfect space for storage or a workshop, and there is easy vehicle access from both the side and rear streets to a large area allocated to off-street parking.
Additional features include:
Split system heating and cooling
Ceiling fans throughout
Gas fireplace in master (within timber mantle surround)

Experience city fringe living at its absolute finest in the form of this beautifully renovated period home situated on the doorstep of all that Bendigo has to offer! Set on an established and manageable town allotment, the premium location is a sought after luxury. Offering a short walk to and from the city centre for work, or a leisurely stroll to enjoy the city's renowned galleries, cafés, restaurants and shopping, you can simplify your lifestyle (and your carbon footprint) by enjoying the convenience of being central to everything!
The totally renovated home is a credit to the current owners, and has left nothing for the new owner to do. The renovations have been sympathetic to the era of the original home, meaning its's character and charm remain in tact. Perfect for singles, couples and young families alike, this sort of hassle-free city lifestyle is highly sought after in today's market. In very solid order, features include beautiful polished hardwood floors, high ceilings, timber windows, plenty of natural light, updated kitchen and bathrooms, new roofing, fresh painting, and split system heating and cooling to name a few.
Internally, the deceptively large floor plan boasts four carpeted bedrooms, or three plus a generous study (it's up to you?). The spacious master suite is complete with walk in robe and its own modern three piece ensuite! The main bathroom has also been fully modernised and includes shower, bath and separate toilet. The central hallway lined with gorgeous timber floors leads to the rear, and opens to the huge open plan kitchen meals and spacious living area. Lovely big windows and glass doors allow plenty of natural light. The spacious kitchen has been wonderfully renovated with all the mod cons included. Boasting expansive bench tops, up to date cooking appliances, dishwasher, and loads of cupboard space, you cant help but be impressed. The living space is light bright and airy, roomy enough for a gathering of lots of friends or family (or intimate enough for two) with fabulous sunny views to the deck area.
Outside is a good sized allotment; its size (approx 733m2) is more than generous for inner city living. With a lovely established garden and landscaped yard already in place, you won't become a slave here! The sun deck at the back door provides a great space to entertain guests and have breakfast, and it flows further into a covered and enclosed space that is perfect for the cooler months. At the rear of the covered space is a laundry, separate toilet, and a handy bike/storage room. A large garden shed is existing, with plenty of space to construct a larger shed if needed. There is a nice yard at the side, with the lawn area an ideal spot for a pool if desired. Off street parking is provided for multiple cars, including a double carport. All this behind the attractive white picket fence that everyone craves so much!
Ideally suited to those looking to experience the convenience of inner city living, you must visit this property to truly appreciate what it could offer you. It will honestly be love at first sight! Given its location and broad appeal, you had better act quick as it surely will not last long!

It gets said a lot, but this opportunity is definitely one not to miss!
Imagine owning just over 1600m2 of land near Lake Weeroona, Bendigo CBD and minutes to Bendigo's new hospital and medical hub, adding to the investment portfolio and setting up your financial future.

A highlight of the property is the generous 6m x 12m three-phase powered and concreted shed with cool room inside, and is surrounded by secure colorbond fencing.
Another added bonus is the two access points, either enter via Strickland Road or around the back off the unsealed road into Riley Street through double gates, where the shed sits.
The location is idyllic; just 1.3km to Lake Weeroona, 2.2km to Bendigo Health and only 2.5km to the CBD.
