kennington-vic-3550,4 Banksia Court Kennington VIC 3550,"Brilliant Home or 6% Return on Investment
The aerial photograph showing where this property is located in Kennington says it all. ...Well almost...
Yes it tells you that this is a top location, but what it doesn't tell you is that this property is also a top performer! Not only does it offer a main four bedroom, two bathroom residence, but it also offers two units which have a proven rental history under the management of our team, Elders Property Management.
The ground floor unit is currently leased for $200 per week and the first floor unit has been leased for $195 per week. This is a combined return of $20,540 per annum. The main home would likely lease in the current market for $390 per week which would return a further $20,280 per annum. Combined this is a total return of $40,820 per annum. Even if you were to offer the top asking price this would represent a return on investment of 6%.
The process of appraising the market value of this property included a direct comparison between it and another Kennington property (details available on request) which sold recently for $610,000. It too offered a main residence and units. Although it offered an additional two units (a total of four) it returned just under $45,000 per annum. Therefore to secure 4 Banksia Court, is to secure a return on investment almost equivalent to a similar property, but with the advantage of two fewer tenancies and the associated upkeep and costs.
What this means is that this is an opportunity for you to establish your own home in the main residence in total comfort and style. You'll benefit from the income of the two units, enabling you to pay down your borrowings significantly each month. From first home buyers, to families and retirees, this is an incredible chance to take a greater control of your personal wealth. Investors can also rent the main residence and pay down any borrowings at a very attractive pace. This is a great ""work from home"" option as the main residence boasts a great home office.
The prime Kennington location offers great access to schools, shopping, dining, and more. It's only a short walk to Kennington Village, Strath Village and Strath Hill shopping precincts, including Aldi and Woolworths supermarkets. There are a variety of nearby dining options, including the popular Edwards Providore, Reservoir Hotel and Kennington Tavern. All levels of education are close by, including primary and secondary schools, as well as La Trobe University. Stroll to nearby Kennington Reservoir and Strathdale Park or any of the numerous bushwalking trails. Great access to the public bus system, gyms, medical facilities and Brennan Park swimming pool. A very safe, quiet and peaceful position and the location at the end of a court means no passing traffic.","SOLD - $610,000","6
