Having Ormond village shops & public transport nearby is just one the surprises in this neatly presented apartment. Security is another feature (intercom entry; secure basement car parking). Add in a tranquil setting, & then inside there are stylish floorboards & a neutral decor adding modernity. Two bedrooms have BIRs, & there are laundry facilities in the bathroom. The open living room (kitchen, sitting & dining) has A/C & a balcony. And then there's the biggest surprise - a spiral staircase winds down to a retreat/study/3rd bedroom! Who'd guess!

Spotless, sizeable and so well located, this is a BIG opportunity for first home buyers, investors and empty-nesters alike. Set to the rear of a small group, this super-sized two bedroom unit dates from a time when space was plentiful, rooms were large and courtyard space wrapped right around. Immaculately maintained ever since, this up-sized unit features a large lounge, a huge kitchen with room for a dining setting, and a separate WC beyond a big laundry. Oversized double bedrooms are fitted with generous robes, the immaculate original bathroom stars solid terrazzo flooring...there's even a newish reverse-cycle air-conditioner for the living-room. Best of all, there's this perfect position with a prized Ormond address - ideal to leave the car in the garage and walk to Ormond and Glenhuntly station and the North Rd bus.
