kennington-vic-3550,1/50 Neale Street KENNINGTON VIC 3550,"A Refreshingly Real Renovation
It's not often an owner takes pride in a renovation to the extent that is on offer at this 2 bedroom unit.
From the new plumbing and wiring to the new floor and window covers throughout, the home is now as good as new.
The new kitchen is striking and the level of care that has gone into it's remodelling is evident the moment you step through the front door.
Demand from investors in Kennington is through the roof and this property is equally suited to owner-occupiers who want the convenience of having the CBD at their fingertips.
