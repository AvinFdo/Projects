Leafy, lovely and so well-located ...something new is set to grow in these rambling grounds. Measuring 17.26m (approx) x 36.14m (approx) for a total of 623sqm (approx), this well-located property is ready to bloom with a new home or townhouse development (subject to Council Approval) to capitalize on dual frontages - one to a picturesque tree-lined cul-de-sac.
