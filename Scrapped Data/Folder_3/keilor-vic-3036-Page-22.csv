To further protect our community, we invite you to view the 360 degree virtual tour before requesting a private inspection to ensure you are satisfied with the layout and location.
If you have viewed the virtual tour and are in a position to buy the property broadly within the indicated price, please call 9379 5616 to arrange a private viewing.
When your booking is confirmed, we'll greet you at the property with a smile (hidden behind our mask) instead of a handshake, then it's business as usual!
