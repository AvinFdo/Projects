kalkallo-vic-3064,100 Mandalay Circuit Beveridge VIC 3753,"Never leave home again!!
If you have been looking for a family sized home, look no further. This genuine home was built with the family in mind, featuring lots of living space, large bedrooms and open plan living, so you have an opportunity to secure a pristine home for you and your family. Whether the kids are young or fully grown there is plenty of living to be done in a home like this; the teenagers will have their own fully enclosed rumpus room to keep them out of the parents hair, the parents can utilise the sitting room for a bit of peace and quiet without getting in the way of the central living area adjacent to the kitchen/family room. Where this property really comes alive, though, is the extras that very few homes have in Mandalay: of course it backs onto the golf course! But it also boasts a massive 898m2 allotment with huge fully enclosed undercover area, drive through access to the backyard and side access for the boat or caravan. The owners have thought of everything here with not a thing to be done: it is simply a case of moving in and moving on.
Why are so many people moving to Mandalay Beveridge? If not for the resort style living and facilities such as a swimming pool, gymnasium, restaurant and community centre, maybe it is for the award winning golf course? Maybe it is just for the lifestyle of community living within easy access to the Hume Freeway? Realistically, I would suggest it is the combination of all of these factors which are making people turn to Mandalay Beveridge for their next home.","SOLD - $730,000","4
