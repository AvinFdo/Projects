white-hills-vic-3550,58 Mundy Street Bendigo VIC 3550,"Large Building and Substantial Allotment in Central Bendigo Commercial or Residential
The address speaks for itself. 58 Mundy Street, Bendigo. A central location, extremely close to office buildings, supermarkets, restaurants, and elite residential homes. The potential for commercial or residential development is enormous.
On approximately 646sqm, this two storey property is suitable for immediate occupancy from residential or commercial tenants. With 10 car parking spaces at the rear, data cabling throughout, and separate water and power meters installed, you will be able to generate an income from one or multiple tenants from Day 1. It is also an exceptional opportunity for business owners to stop paying rent and occupy your own premises.
Each level has virtually identical floorplans consisting of two office spaces/bedrooms, a large living room, bathroom, kitchen and dining area. Each also has heating and cooling and double door access to a balconette looking towards Mundy Street, plus upstairs has a small balcony to the rear which captures the views of the city skyline.
Looking towards the future, and what may be' Concept drawings have been completed, with a view to developing up to 8 apartments with underground parking behind the existing building. Situated in the CBD H3 area, buildings could be constructed up to 12m in height (STCA).
A total refurbishment would take the existing property to the next level, though paying tribute to the art deco features including decorative glass, checkerboard fireplace hearths, and huge stunning ceiling plaster works would likely be taken into account. There is also the opportunity to create a shopfront downstairs, without the need for altering the existing entrance to upstairs (STCA).
In all aspects, this flexible and desirable property in Central Bendigo is an attractive prospect to investors, developers, owner occupiers and tenants.","SOLD - $825,000","4
