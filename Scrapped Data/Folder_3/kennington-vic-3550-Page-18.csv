This charming property is family-friendly in both design and location. Situated an easy walk to schools, kindergartens, sporting ground, pharmacy and close to all the amenities on offer at Strath Village and the Kennington Reservoir, this newly refurbished house is ideally positioned.
Centrally located in a quiet street, this weatherboard home offers a neat front garden and secure access to the rear of the property from both sides of the house.
Stairs lead up to a large concrete landing that offers a picturesque outlook over Bendigo’s CBD. Through the front door, you are greeted with a spacious and bright formal entry hallway that offers fantastic built-in storage.
Many original features have been lovingly retained – including authentic timber floorboards, and unique Art Deco cornices in all rooms – and the modern touches, such as the feature lighting in the entry, add a contemporary edge to the design.
Off the hallway are the three bedrooms – all with ceiling fans and the front two offering large windows and built-in robes. The good-sized master bedroom features a walk-through robe leading to a brand new, spacious and light-filled ensuite.
The modern, new family bathroom is also located off the main entry, featuring a large shower and great bathtub.

The brand new kitchen features a high gloss contemporary finish and every detail has been considered including a four-burner gas cooktop, electric oven, dishwasher, soft-close drawers.
Plumbing is ready for the refrigerator if required and the property also enjoys ducted cooling throughout.
Through the rear door you have access to the undercover entertaining area and gorgeous timber deck. A small bar, along with lighting and access to power, ensures this area is ready and waiting for a relaxing summer night outdoors.
The huge backyard, with lawn and large tree, is perfect for family living and the single shed, which is easily accessed at the end of the driveway and through the secure front gates, is powered and offers concrete flooring.
At the rear of the shed is a smaller workshed; perfect as a workshop, to house tools, create a studio or perhaps a spacious cubby house for the kids.
This lovely property has been renovated to a high standard, providing ample natural light throughout, a quality finish and stylish fittings in a neutral palette.

Designed and built by local architect James Harrington in 1973, this beautiful family home offers all the charm and detail of this character filled era, stylishly updated with every modern convenience you could require.
This distinctive, immaculately presented property is perfectly positioned in an established area just minutes from the Bendigo CBD and Strath Village, and walking distance to supermarkets, schools and childcare options.
The home is positioned on an exceptionally large elevated block to capture views of Bendigo to both the front and rear of the property. Designed to make the most of the natural light and cross-flow breeze, the home has been oriented in such a way so as to fully appreciate every time of day.
An oversized single garage provides room for a workstation, and two carports to the side of the home allow access to the back of the property. A long sweeping brick driveway offers plenty of off-street parking for the many visitors you will want to entertain in this fabulous space.
Modern fixtures and fittings have been added to perfectly complement the classic stylings of the property. Comfort and pleasure is assured with new, quality, eco-friendly carpeting, built in wireless audio system, gas-ducted central heating, split system air conditioning and ceiling fans throughout the home. The high roofline with exposed beams and clerestory windows give great space and bathe the house in abundant natural light.
The open plan front of the home features a spacious, light-filled living room with study area, a large dining area and stylishly refurbished kitchen. All modern conveniences such as a dishwasher, double-oven, five-burner gas cooktop, neat rollaway appliance cupboard, soft close drawers and a large walk-in pantry provide exceptional functionality and luxury.
Extending from the main kitchen space is a practical built-in breakfast nook and bar area which opens out to the large central undercover courtyard – providing wonderful indoor/outdoor living, ideal for entertaining or just simply relaxing.
As you make your way down the wide main hall, large windows looking out to the courtyard again provide masses of natural light. A handy utilities cupboard and a very functional laundry with ample built-in storage space are found here along with access to the two-way family bathroom - featuring the original bathtub and shower, as well as a separate toilet, which also offers two-way access.
An expansive and luxurious master retreat at the rear of the home provides a joyful sanctuary. Offering a huge bedroom & sitting area equipped with split system and ceiling fan along with a large, exceptionally fitted out walk-in robe and contemporary ensuite, this is an area to truly enjoy.
The three additional bedrooms are all generously sized, and all provide either large built-in wardrobes or walk-through robes.
Out the back door is a wonderful elevated decked area, perfect for entertaining and enjoying picturesque sunsets. The large backyard below is cleverly designed to provide plenty of options to keep the kids entertained, with a number of mature trees providing ample summer shade. Features such as a large grassed area, fire pit, garden shed, veggie patches and a chook pen are sure to keep everyone happy.
