whittington-vic-3219,4 Solomon Court Breakwater VIC 3219,"Best buy in Breakwater.
This recently updated solid home in a quiet location is packed with potential.
Ready for the new owners to move straight in, there is nothing to be done, yet the home offers plenty of scope to add value with capital improvement options, including redevelopment (STCA) and is in an area that holds great potential for strong yields and capital growth. A no brainer for value!
Arguably one of the best suburbs for investors and first home buyers alike, Breakwater is largely viewed as having strong potential future growth due to the close proximity to the CBD, numerous shopping complexes, train station, Garden Street cafe precinct, Eastern Gardens and more. A short walk delivers you to St Albans sporting reserve and multiple education centres including pre-school, primary school and Tafe.
On over 600m2 and tucked away in a private, family friendly court, this home has been well maintained with a single owner for over 40 years and has recently had some refurbishments including newly polished hardwood floors, paint throughout and carpets in the bedrooms. With concrete stumps ensuring a solid structure and comprising 3 bedrooms all with TV points, central bathroom, open meals / kitchen, generous living and laundry, the home is the ideal solid, low maintenance entry level option with a huge upside.
Hefty bills are a thing of the past with gas appliances, a team of solar panels and a solar skylight eliminating the majority of your energy costs, whilst the climate is controlled year round with reverse cycle air conditioning. The home also enjoys the added security of a home alarm system.
A large rear yard with garden shed offers space for the kids and pets with flexibility to utilise the front, back or side yards for entertaining, whilst an oversized single garage (7.2m x 5m) provides loads of storage with additional space for a workshop giving the family tradesperson their own sanctuary.
When value and potential are important to you, this home should top your list.
