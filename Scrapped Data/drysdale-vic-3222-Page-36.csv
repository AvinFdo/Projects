drysdale-vic-3222,43 Huntingdon Street DRYSDALE VIC 3222,"SPACE AROUND YOU ON THIS SEMI RURAL BLOCK
We have a home on just over half an acre close to the Drysdale Township that needs a new family to enjoy what it has to offer.
This property has many features, one of the main ones being
the ample size of the family room that is big enough for a pool table plus ample space for furniture to lounge around in. Many a party has been held in this space. Through to a formal dining which includes an open fire place and bar. Open plan living, meals and kitchen with walk in pantry. The main bedroom has WIR and ensuite, while the other three bedrooms have built in robes.
A place to study is off the dining room.
You can climatically control your environment by choosing ducted heating or a wood heater or a split system, all seasons covered. Vacuuming is a breeze with the ducted system through out the home.
Outside there is the making of your own hobby farm: a chook pen, veggie patch and bird aviary. A double width double length garage would suit the man of the house who needs space for the projects or tradie trailers.
A BBQ area provides a place to relax with family and friends with a clear view of the kids in the yard.
Not far from the main shopping complex and amenities is this family home with space around it, in a quiet street. An inspection will impress.
