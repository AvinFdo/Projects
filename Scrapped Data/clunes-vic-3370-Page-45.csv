clunes-vic-3370,2 North Street Creswick VIC 3363,"Stunning Brand New Home
In ship shape condition and promising years of low maintenance, this energy efficient steel framed new JG King build will delight those looking for an easy ?new home? option with a great outlook across the roof tops of charming Creswick.
Designed to take advantage of the views and to benefit from maximum use of the sloping allotment to the rear, this home is walking distance to the township; just 25minutes to Daylesford and a quick 15minute commute to nearby Ballarat.
Passing by the formal lounge, the effective wide timber laminate flooring creates a durable base from the front door right through to the kitchen, dining and living room, while the three bedrooms have been styled with deep grey ?wall to wall? carpet, built in robes and slimline blinds. The master suite is pampered by a handy ensuite, walk in robes and views from the large front window, while the cool grey palette provides a great base to add your own embellishments and personal décor. A walk in linen press is present in the capacious independent laundry, while the family bathroom and separate toilet cover the balance of the hygiene facilities with contemporary ease.
Designed with loads of light and masses of room, the kitchen not only boasts a three point working triangle, it also offers a walk in pantry, granite benchtops, central island and excellent storage facilities. The adjoining dining zone is designed to enable easy connection with the chef, while also offering interaction with those relaxing either inside or out. Sliding doors open onto a well protected entertaining space, which also provides a peaceful zone to sip a wine, read a paper or join friends for a coffee. Ducted heating and cooling keep the home comfortable with a double lock up garage with internal access (and rear roller door) allowing movement about the back yard if necessary.
With extra room to play with at the rear, this 802m2 property could profit from further landscaping to incorporate the elevation of the land and the views across the town, while also providing a further area to erect a shed or additional alfresco (STCA). School bus pick up is just metres away, therefore this home will provide the perfect place for families to grow.","SOLD - $375,000","3

Loughlin Park' is located 20 minutes North of Ballarat, 15 minutes from Daylesford & 10 minutes to Creswick and offers 197.68 acres or 80 hectares on one title with two sealed road frontages. Highly productive, this farm is one of the best examples of Farm Management you will find.
Zoned Farming, the current owners have renovated the pastures and improved production with the application of poultry manure and lime, and have direct drilled 90% of pastures over the last 10 years. The soil types vary from Red, Grey to Black Loam. There are 10 paddocks with troughs fed by town water, 4 dams and an unequipped stock bore insuring an abundance of water in the toughest of seasons.
The undercover working improvements are outstanding with the cattle yards (handling 100+ head), scales, a vet crush and adjustable loading race combined with high quality lighting via 3ph and 240v power enables work at night. Three large hay shed that hold approx. 600 large bales plus a large machinery shed with 3ph power add to the properties working facilities. The property currently carries approx. 100 grown head of Angus cattle. There is also 9 additional acres in which are currently leased by the Vendors from council, and could potentially be carried on by the new owners (STCA).
A comfortable 3 bedroom brick veneer home with open plan living, electric cooking, gas hot water system, wood heating, reverse cycle air conditioning and town water makes for comfortable living. The home also has potential to be leased at approx. $250 per week.
