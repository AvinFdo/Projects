croydon-south-vic-3136,25 Andrew Crescent CROYDON SOUTH VIC 3136,"Expressions of Interest by Thursday 16 July at 5.30pm (Unless Sold Prior)
Often sought, seldom found (1,472 sq m approximately)
You have invested time and research finding your perfect new home, now you need the ideal land parcel to realize that dream. It can't be just any old block: you want exclusivity, plenty of open space with stunning native surrounds, but not too far from convenience.
This 1,472 sq m approx. lies in a coveted enclave of no-through streets bordering Ringwood East and Tintern schools. Slightly elevated, this pristine land has never been developed, creating an exceptional blank canvas with the freedom to build the new house you want (STCA).
Downsizers struggling to find a suitable unit may design and build the home they need, while family buyers and young professionals will appreciate the quiet surrounds and proximity to Tintern Schools, Cheong Park, Eastfield Mall, Maroondah Hospital and a short commute to stations, Eastland and EastLink access.
Quality vacant land is at a premium and therefore highly sought-after, so this big block could be your last chance for a tree-change in a boutique location.
- 1472 sq m approx.
- Ready to build (STCA)
- Walk to Tintern schools
