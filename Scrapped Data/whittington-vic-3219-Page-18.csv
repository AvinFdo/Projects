whittington-vic-3219,Lot 1/53 Townsend Road WHITTINGTON VIC 3219,"Two bedroom cottage home with a modern touch.
Living in a small flat and wanting more room? Property prices to high for you to buy? This may be the break you have been looking for. Priced to sell and in a great central location.
This home is located close to schools, sporting facilities, public transport and only 10 minutes by car from CBD of Geelong. This property will surely appeal to many first home buyers, the renovator within and or the astute investor. The small cottage home has plenty of charm with its original high ceilings, faux fire place mantle in the master and polished floor boards in the bedrooms and kitchen area. As you enter in the home you pass the bedrooms on the left and right and then the hallway opens up to a large lounge area. From the lounge you have direct access to the kitchen, bathroom or the rear courtyard via two large wooden doors.
The home has had a modern update while keeping with cottage feel of the home. The bathroom has been updated to include a large shower, toilet, vanity unit and tiled floor. Making good use of the space available the laundry has also been installed in the bathroom, keeping the main wet areas together. The kitchen has been updated with laminate bench tops, s/s upright gas cook top and oven and ample storage and bench space. The home is temperature controlled by a reverse cycle air conditioner placed in the lounge.
The block has been subdivided into two separate titles with common ground allocated for both properties to use once 2nd dwelling has been constructed. The north facing courtyard at the rear of the property is ideal for entertaining and has room allocated for a single car garage to be built.
