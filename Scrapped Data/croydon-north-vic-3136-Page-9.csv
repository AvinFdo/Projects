This property is positioned at the very rear of a sleek and boutique townhouse development so you’re well away from the service road. Gorgeous Tasmanian Oak floors, luxe stone in the kitchen and bathrooms, quality carpet, and a variety of other modern designer touches are sure to impress buyers which will range from young and growing families to empty nesters.
The undoubted highlight of this property is the expansive central lounge and dining zone, which lets in fantastic natural light thanks to its northerly aspect. The pristine kitchen is included in this main space and is brilliant for the chef of the house thanks to an island bench, stainless steel Blanco appliances including a 900mm cooktop and oven, and a sizeable hidden pantry area which can be an additional space for meals preparation.
The sizeable master bedroom is positioned downstairs and comes with a walk-in robe, ensuite, and access to a private garden. Three bedrooms with BIRs are located upstairs and easily access a charming living retreat and chic bathroom. The north-facing courtyard and garden at the rear is very easy to maintain yet has enough room for outdoor BBQs and entertaining friends and family.
Other property inclusions are a laundry, downstairs powder room, ducted heating, evaporative cooling, ducted vacuum, rainwater tank, video intercom, and a huge double garage. Moments to Luther College, Yarra Valley Grammar, Croydon Hill Primary School, Chirnside Park Shopping Centre, Warrien Reserve, buses, and Croydon Station.","SOLD - $695,000","4
