doncaster-vic-3108,1 Cantala Drive Doncaster VIC 3108,"Renovated to absolute perfection.
No expense was spared in meticulously renovating this contemporary single-level showpiece - and it shows. Boasting an elevated position with views, completely gutted, refurbished to the highest of standards and showcasing the absolute best modern living has to offer, this strong and solid one-owner four-bedroom family residence is therefore essentially brand new!
Indoor-outdoor living is a standout feature of the sun-kissed open-plan living zone and contemporary lounge (with sparkling polished timber floorboards underfoot), both of which extend onto a central north-facing entertainer's deck that offers the perfect setting for alfresco dining or a morning coffee break.
Sleek stone benchtops, modern cabinetry with soft-close drawers and quality Miele appliances (including an integrated dishwasher) accentuate the five-star quality of the brand new kitchen, which forms part of the beautifully tiled family and dining area, while two brand new bathrooms (master with ensuite) are on hand to service the four excellent bedrooms, all of which are intelligently zoned to offer a superior level of privacy and comfort.
Abundant natural light, evaporative cooling, ducted heating, security alarm and a video intercom enhance the contemporary character of the single-level layout, while a fantastic storage area under the house, remote double garage (accessed via Clancys Lane), low maintenance landscaped gardens, private backyard, repointed roof, new downpipes and a breathtaking view towards the Dandenong Ranges adds another layer of positive appeal.
Offering a five-star standard of living inside, it's also much of the same when you venture outside and discover this premier location is an easy walk to Ruffey Lake Park, Aquarena Leisure Centre, Westfield Shoppingtown and St Gregory The Great Primary School and just minutes to the Eastern Freeway.
