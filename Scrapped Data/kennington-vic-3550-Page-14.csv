kennington-vic-3550,9 Ningana Drive Kennington VIC 3550,"FANTASTIC FAMILY HOME SURROUNDED BY LUSH GARDEN
Situated on a huge allotment at the end of a quiet court, in a coveted Kennington locale, is this fantastic family home surrounded by a beautiful established garden. Positioned in a prestigious area bordered by quality, established homes, this beautifully presented property is just minutes from Kennington Reservoir, Strath Village, bushland, childcare, schools, medical facilities and more.
Set back from the road in peaceful surrounds, the home has been impeccably cared for over the years with recent additions adding to the appeal.
Coming in to the spacious front entry, off to the right is a large formal living area with a great bay window, with the room providing plenty of space to create an additional dining space if required.
To the left of the entry is a room that would work equally as well as fourth bedroom or a fantastic home office. At the end of the entry hall is a doorway to the large kitchen and dining space. The sizable dining space offers plenty of room for an additional lounge area and the kitchen includes a door leading through to the formal living room.
The country-style kitchen features a double induction cooktop, oven, dishwasher and nook for a microwave and fridge. Further modern conveniences include ducted evaporative air conditioning and heating throughout the home.
From the dining room is a hallway with two large linen cupboards and leading off the hallway are two good-sized bedrooms, both with large built-in robes and a ceiling fan in one. The hallway also leads to a large light and bright laundry with built-in storage and a glass sliding door to the rear garden; a stunning newly renovated family bathroom complete with a freestanding bathtub and modern fixtures and fittings and a separate toilet.
At the end of the hallway is the master bedroom providing a large walk-through robe and a new ensuite with walk-in shower. This light-filled room also features a large bay window and additional storage.
From the main living area, sliding doors open out to the rear of the property – a space ideal for entertaining; overlooking the solar heated inground pool and gazebo set amongst the beautifully landscaped garden.
A fantastic porch wraps around the rear of the house with an undercover al fresco area, a spa and a double shed at the rear of the block. The double garage, attached to the home, offers access to the backyard via both a door and vehicle access.
A secure gate at the rear of the property offers access to a reserve and playground backing on to the allotment. Side gate access is available and the established plants, irrigated fruit trees and two water tanks complete this well cared for property.
Ideal for a family looking to live in a wonderful area and enjoy a home that, whilst being ready to move right into, also offers fantastic scope to really create something special.

kennington-vic-3550,10 Yallambee Drive Kennington VIC 3550,"Location, Location, Location...!!
Looking for a well-built residence in a great location to occupy, renovate or rent out? This architectural time capsule somehow escaped restyling of subsequent eras, allowing new owners the option of retaining untainted retro treasures or undertaking a total transformation. Welcome modern appliances have been installed though, including ducted heating and reverse cycle air conditioning.
Superb cathedral ceilings lined with timber that make the enormous living zone feel even larger than it is are well worth preserving. Central to the lounge and dining zones is a bar that can be used for its original intention or repurposed. It would be perfect as a butler's pantry, positioned alongside the walk-in pantry. Able to supply supervision of homework in and meals to the dining area, via a wide servery window, the cook is not isolated in the otherwise enclosed kitchen. Plenty of storage and prep space plus a dishwasher also to keep the cook happy.
Clustered around the main bathroom with double vanity are 3 bedrooms and a study or fourth. Two have built-in robes, while the master bedroom has walk-in robe, ensuite and glass door leading directly outside.
Outdoor entertaining can be enjoyed undercover of a broad verandah and the grounds are delightfully landscaped. Gates allow entrance into the backyard where parking for a caravan, trailer or boat can be secured, but a double carport takes daily care of cars.
Within walking distance of all amenities, even the CBD, wise buyers will want to be quick to act on inspecting this address!","SOLD - $400,000","3

kennington-vic-3550,4 Willow Drive Kennington VIC 3550,"The ultimate family environment
Impressively revived in recent years to fully satisfy the standards of modern living, this 4 bedroom home has a great deal to offer behind its handsome foliage-toned facade.
The lounge and huge family room lie at opposite ends of the house, ideal for varied recreational pursuits and henceforth family harmony. In between, a very large dining area has ample space for a multi-tasking parent's home office or supervising kid's homework. Abundant dark chocolate and espresso coloured kitchen cabinetry include many pot drawers. Alongside a wall oven sits the minimalist profile of a seamless ceramic cooktop.
All 4 bedrooms contain built-in robes. Both the ensuite and main bathroom have been well rejuvenated like the rest of the home. Heating as well as cooling are ducted throughout, and the massive bonus of a 3kW solar power system minimises energy bills. Adjoining the rear of the residence, an elevated undercover deck is brilliant for barbeques and general outdoor enjoyment. It overlooks a private swimming pool that comes complete with blanket and water tank. The approximately 761m2 property also encompasses fruit trees, a single carport and garage with automatic door. With sport and recreation facilities, shopping and services, school, college and uni nearby, plus buses into the CBD, fuel expenses will be greatly reduced too. Perfectly positioned within walking distance to almost every amenity any aged family member could require, this address truly has it all. It sincerely is the ultimate family environment.","SOLD - $460,000","4

kennington-vic-3550,12/190 St Aidans Road Kennington VIC 3550,"IMMACULATE TOWNHOUSE ON HISTORIC GROUNDS
This stunning property is located at the quiet end of a row of stylishly built beautiful townhouses, created to sit alongside the old St Aidan’s Orphanage and the grounds surrounding. Perfectly situated in easy walking distance from Strath Village, Strath Hill and Kennington Reservoir, this contemporary home is close to all amenities.
Enter through a beautifully landscaped courtyard and past the deck at the front of the home, offering views across the immaculately maintained grounds. As part of the Body Corporate, the owner would benefit from the gardens being cared for by professionals.
Walking into the home and through the entry hall, you are welcomed into the large lounge and dining space. Beautiful views from the vast picture window include the gardens and the city beyond.
An extended pantry and euro laundry is tucked neatly away in cabinetry across from kitchen and the modern kitchen enjoys granite overlay benchtops and high-end Bosch appliances including a dishwasher, gas cooktop, electric oven. Ample storage throughout the kitchen includes a neat rollaway benchtop cupboard for additional appliances.
Heading through to the rear of the house is a powder room and then a formal lounge. From the lounge, sliding plantation shutters and glass sliding doors open wide out to the rear deck and neat landscaped courtyard. Beautiful lemon trees neatly surround the artificial turf, and large slate paving lead to the timber feature wall that neatly hides access to the double garage.
The garage, with its roller door opening from the driveway at the rear, has additional storage and a clothesline.
Back indoors, from the front entrance, carpeted stairs lead you to the second storey. A skylight above the stairwell, and in the family bathroom, provides additional light and a landing at the top of the stairs serves as a small library.
Two good-sized bedrooms, both with built-in robes, look out over the back courtyard and the family bathroom is next to the separate toilet.
Finally, explore the luxurious master suite. Glass sliding doors lead out to a balcony, providing plenty of light and beautiful sunrise views over the city. A large walk-in robe with ample practical shelving and hanging space is next to the light and bright generously-sized ensuite, providing a beautiful outlook of the estate and beyond from the cathedral window.
This lovely modern home provides all the features you could require, including downlights and refrigerative ducted heating and cooling, and a stylish neutral décor allowing you to make it your own.
Feel secure and at home as a part of this high-end estate in a beautiful townhouse providing a low-maintenance, relaxing lifestyle.","SOLD - $450,000","3
