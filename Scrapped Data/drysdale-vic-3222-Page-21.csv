drysdale-vic-3222,71 Princess Street Drysdale VIC 3222,"Semi-Rural Block - Only 500m From Town!
Set back from the road and sited on approximately one and a quarter glorious acres, this fantastic property is like having your very own private resort complete with pool, leafy treed gardens and recreation areas. Three living zones give options for all the family. A rumpus room at the rear of the home allows children to raise a ruckus and not disturb the entire household. The meals area is immense, easily able to accommodate another sofa or two. Open to this area and appointed with top of the range appliances, the kitchen is simply superb. Quality cabinetry, pot drawers, wine rack, walk-in pantry and polished granite benches combine to form a beautiful and highly functional catering zone.
Accommodation includes four bedrooms, main with en suite and walk-in robe. A home office off the entry with an entire wall devoted to built-in shelves has ample space or could be used as a fifth bedroom. Thoughtfully designed to ease the tension of morning peak hour, the shower and bath are in a separate room to the vanity. Heating and cooling are ducted throughout, and a gas wall heater has also been installed in a central position. Double glazed windows are an added benefit!
Salt-chlorinated, the in-ground swimming pool and spa are a dream come true to keep kids happy at home during the summer months. Solar heating extends seasonal use, and the adjoining undercover outdoor living zone is perfect for pool parties.
In the enormous backyard, fencing surrounds a basketball practice area and chicken coop, along with many fruit trees and raised garden beds ideal for growing vegies. Measuring about 147 metres, a magnificent shed contains concrete floor and power, roller doors, benches and shelving. A 53 metre garden shed also has concrete floor and though on town water, two tanks supply 44,000 litre rainwater capacity.
In very close proximity to schools, shopping and much more, this wonderful family property will be hard to beat.","SOLD - $770,000","5

The master bedroom has an en suite and built-in storage, while two kids bedrooms (with built-in robes) access the bathroom and separate toilet. Other features include SS-AC and polished floorboards.
Extensive parking and storage is a huge plus- with two carports, a secure lock-up garage and large workshop offering a bounty of space for vehicles, boat and trailer, and your hobbies and projects.
