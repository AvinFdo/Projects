An exceptional opportunity to secure one or both of these superb multi unit development sites (STCA) moments from the station, shops, pre school and across the road from the HMAS Cerberus naval base.
With each totalling more than 1200sqm and both with two street frontages, there are numerous design options for maximising the number of dwellings and private open space areas on the sites.
Strong demand for rental accommodation also exists for housing close to the train line and there is potential to explore leasing options with the Defence Housing Authority.
With only an original 1920s fisherman's cottage on the site, call your architect and builder and get started on this exciting project right in the heart of Crib Point and moments from the Stony Point ferry and boat ramp.
The auction of the adjoining property at 3 Point Road is on Saturday 5th November at 12.30pm. Inspect strictly as advertised only.
