kennington-vic-3550,3/68 Condon Street KENNINGTON VIC 3550,"MAKE YOUR MOVE WITH CONFIDENCE!
I'd act quickly. This is more than just a unit / townhouse. It is a home with room, and added features that will surprise you. In a prime location, nicely set back from the road it is quiet and private. With single garage & visitor parking, the home offers abundance of storage, and a light & bright atmosphere. With heating and cooling via reverse cycle, the kitchen is well appointed and overall presentation is neat as a pin. The two bedrooms are sizeable, master with plenty of built in robes and a second split system. With bathroom close by, and access through the laundry to the lovely entertaining zone for BBQ's & gatherings. Your land at the side of the property, adds an extra bonus to the property, with a grassed area & landscaped yard, it is again private & spacious, but not overly high maintenance.

kennington-vic-3550,25 Bolton Drive KENNINGTON VIC 3550,"Easy Living in Style
This quality home in a prestigious locale is a blueprint for the good life.
Close to brilliant shopping amenities, schools, the university and parks, the area is established and very leafy, with well-maintained streetscapes.
It's a busy part of Bendigo, very desirable, but because this is a u-shaped street, you won't get through traffic at all, so it's a quiet haven of domestic comfort.
The home is north-south oriented, and set on the high side of the street, so you have the open feeling of sky and trees to look out on.
Excellent renovation has turned the inside into a showpiece. The tiled entry opens into an open plan family entertainment area. Wide sliding doors lead on to the undercover outdoor dining patio which overlooks a fully landscaped yard and beyond to the in-ground pool.
There's a spacious dining area inside too, adjacent to the kitchen which is sparkling and beautifully designed. Gas bench-top cooker, breakfast bar with pendant lights, skylight, plenty of benchtop and, of course, room for all your appliances, you'd be hard-pressed to find a single improvement.
Four spacious bedrooms are sensibly designed, with the refurbished bathroom and separate toilet dividing the two kids' room from the parents' room and ensuite, which has the fourth bedroom adjacent.
The laundry leads to a superbly organized outdoor space, this one for practical purposes, with a small garden shed, and raised veggie beds.
The tour completes at the spacious carport and tandem lock up garage, with space behind for a workroom or storage shed.
Good fencing for maximum privacy and you're done: a home with absolutely nothing to do and everything to enjoy.","SOLD - $405,000","4
