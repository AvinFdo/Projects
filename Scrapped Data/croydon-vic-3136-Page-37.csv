An outstanding location that is close to sought after schools, shops and public transport. This immaculate three-bedroom family home is positioned for absolute convenience. Yarra Valley Grammar, Luther College, as well as Good Shepherd and Kalinda Primary Schools and Melba College are all a walk or short commute away, with buses frequently servicing the surrounding neighbourhood.

If you love the thought of being self-sufficient and love organic produce, you will simply love this garden. You will also find two water tanks and a large 6x11m garage (approx.) with its own toilet facilities. Make the time to view this rewarding property.","SOLD - $690,000","3
