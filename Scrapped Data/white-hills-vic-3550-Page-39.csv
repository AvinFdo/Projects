white-hills-vic-3550,22 Nabilla Crescent Strathdale VIC 3550,"Capital Idea!
You'll have noticed that the current Bendigo property market is competitive. I think this competition is creating an increasing awareness of the economics of real estate. When the demand for property is greater than the supply of property we must be quick to recognise value and quick to act to secure it. Many buyers are naming three main common criteria in their search for value, being: location, lifestyle and the prospect of capital growth. Smart!
In considering location there's an increasing awareness that well established neighbourhoods in popular suburbs represent great value. Strathdale has long been regarded as a most appealing location. The suburb has beautiful streetscapes, quality constructions and a variety of housing styles and thoughtful designs. Strathdale is also prized for its picturesque natural surrounds and access to popular amenities.
It's these natural surrounds and popular amenities that elevate the lifestyle benefits of this property. Nabilla Crescent is positioned opposite Kennington Reservoir, and walking distance to Strathdale Park. As well as Kennington Village, Strath Village and Strath Hill. The nearby Harley Street Cafe and Edwards Providore are two very popular destinations for those who have just enjoyed a shop, a visit to a nearby gym or pool, time at a playground with the kids or grandkids or a walk around the Reservoir with friends.
This top location and these highly sought after lifestyle benefits are likely strong indicators of the prospect of future capital growth. As are the traits of the property itself. There's an increasing appetite in the market for four bedroom, two bathroom homes. This residence offers four robed bedrooms and three bathrooms. You'll notice that the family room has a bathroom and is in addition to a living room, formal dining and lounge. This opens up the option of a fifth bedroom and the opportunity to capitalise on the rental return of a five bedroom home. The property has great access to public transport, schools and La Trobe University.
If location, lifestyle and the prospect of future capital growth are also your main criteria, you'll surely agree that 22 Nabilla Crescent offers great value. Securing it is a capital idea!","SOLD - $470,000","4
