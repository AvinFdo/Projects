kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,11 Muriel Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Priority package
If size is what matters most on your list of important priorities, then you can't go past this 4 bedroom property. Extremely rarely within city streets do vast expanses of affordable land become available, let alone with a huge family home as well as a massive shed! Yet here on 1371m2, is a tremendously roomy residence with garage and 13x8 metre shed with concrete floor, power, double roller door and security system! Indoors, this welcoming home has 9' ceilings and timber cathedral ceilings that soar overhead, as Tasmanian oak dados line some of the walls. Heating and cooling are ducted throughout, while a gas cooktop and electric wall oven along with dishwasher are employed in the kitchen.Positioned on a corner permits direct vehicle access to the massive fully-fenced backyard, where remote-controlled gates are a clever inclusion. Making the yard all the more inviting, merbau decking overlooks gardens watered by sprinkler system via pump to 2 rainwater tanks, together totalling approximately 10,000 litre capacity. Only a 6 minute cycle or a 20 minute walk will get the kids to school. It's even less to shops and health services or a little more to catch a train. If driving to commute to the big smoke or most other major towns or cities, this handy location close to several highways to almost anywhere around Victoria, then lead you back home, sweet home again!","SOLD - $483,000","4

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,11 Muriel Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Priority package
If size is what matters most on your list of important priorities, then you can't go past this 4 bedroom property. Extremely rarely within city streets do vast expanses of affordable land become available, let alone with a huge family home as well as a massive shed! Yet here on 1371m2, is a tremendously roomy residence with garage and 13x8 metre shed with concrete floor, power, double roller door and security system! Indoors, this welcoming home has 9' ceilings and timber cathedral ceilings that soar overhead, as Tasmanian oak dados line some of the walls. Heating and cooling are ducted throughout, while a gas cooktop and electric wall oven along with dishwasher are employed in the kitchen.Positioned on a corner permits direct vehicle access to the massive fully-fenced backyard, where remote-controlled gates are a clever inclusion. Making the yard all the more inviting, merbau decking overlooks gardens watered by sprinkler system via pump to 2 rainwater tanks, together totalling approximately 10,000 litre capacity. Only a 6 minute cycle or a 20 minute walk will get the kids to school. It's even less to shops and health services or a little more to catch a train. If driving to commute to the big smoke or most other major towns or cities, this handy location close to several highways to almost anywhere around Victoria, then lead you back home, sweet home again!","SOLD - $483,000","4

Neat and tidy brick veneer located at the quiet end of Browning Street close to public transport, schools etc.
It offers three bedrooms, all with robes, spacious lounge and galley-style kitchen with big breakfast bar separating it from the meals area.
Kitchen is equipped with gas cooker, near new Miele dishwasher and plenty of storage. Meals and lounge areas both open to a paved and covered alfresco area for seamless outdoor living and entertaining.
Bathroom and laundry are centrally placed with two gas heaters and ducted evaporative air conditioning circulating for year-round comfort.
Set on an easily managed 667 square metre (approx.) block with secure lawn areas for toddlers or pets and side access to the backyard for off-street parking for caravan, trailer etc.
It's safe to say that the hard work replacing the gutters on a build of this age has already been done with fresh external paintwork to finish.
The spacious garage comfortably fits a car whilst still providing room to tinker about on the fixed workbench with electricity already in place.
Everything about the property is low maintenance making it an ideal first home, investment proposition or the perfect home base for grey nomads to lock up and leave between trips.

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,381 High Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Quarter Acre Investment
This property is perfect for starting or expanding your Property Portfolio. Situated on a huge approx.1050 sqm block in booming Kangaroo Flat (with High Street frontage) this property is ripe for development (STCA). Add to this the bonus that the existing house is a solid weatherboard home currently tenanted at $260 a week- what have you got to lose! Even if you buy now and develop at your leisure...
The comfortable home has three bedrooms (all BIR), a spacious lounge with a gas log fire and refrigerated air conditioner, renovated timber kitchen with ample bench space, dishwasher and gas/electric cooking. The fully tiled bathroom is clean and neat with shower, vanity and toilet. Polished floorboards enhance the living areas and the bedrooms are carpeted. There is an existing 8mx3m shed with power and concrete to one side of the block.
Of interest to an investor is the large, flat expanse of yard at the back of the house and the 3.5m driveway that provides access to it- making it an easy prospect to develop (STCA) whilst leaving the existing home untouched at the front.","SOLD - $265,000","3
