clifton-springs-vic-3222,11 Mirrabooka Drive Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"Elevated 2-storey family home with brilliant bay views
You can’t put a price on beautiful bay views filtered through the branches of a mighty ghost gum, so consider it as a gift with this substantial 2-storey brick home with loads of potential. Sitting on a gently sloping block in Clifton Springs, the property reaps the benefits of its prime position and outstanding coastal panorama. From the street, an elevated driveway meets a massive double garage/workshop/storage area - a Mecca for any man who likes cars and tinkering with power tools. Once inside the house, the ground floor presents a compact office/den, a bedroom, a laundry with a small bathroom annex, and a large L-shaped lounge with a brick feature wall, a gas space heater, and views of the terraced back garden. Taking the stairs, the excitement mounts as you reach the lounge/dining room that opens to a substantial north-west verandah - and those marvellous views. Outdoor entertainment is clearly on the menu here, with the constant opportunity of watching activities on the bay and glimpses of the You Yangs, while dining on fine food and perfectly chilled wine. The practical kitchen, with its tiled splashbacks, dishwasher and electric stove, also enjoys the light and warmth of its northern aspect. The master bedroom has a walk-in robe and ensuite with shower, vanity and WC - plus it’s own west facing mini-verandah. Two more bedrooms (one with a ceiling fan) share another bathroom with shower, bath and vanity - and a separate toilet. As it stands, the property is perfectly liveable, but some minor repairs and a lick of paint would transform it into a delightfully comfortable home with many unique and enviable features. Plus there’s scope for major renovations (STCA), with luxury lifestyle possibilities on offer. Walk to shops, parks and the Clifton Springs waterfront, or drive to shopping centres, Bellarine Peninsula wineries and restaurants, coastal towns and beaches, and the bustling city of Geelong.","SOLD - $515,000","5
