essendon-vic-3040,115A Woodland Street Essendon VIC 3040,"Blue Chip Opportunity
Superbly placed on a premium plantation street within the coveted Strathmore Secondary College zone and just walking distance to North Essendon Village, Glenbervie train station plus Woodlands and Napier Parks, this two bedroom Art Deco home will resonate with families, builders and renovators. Spanning a large allotment of 727m2 with a 29.5m frontage (both measures approximate), developers will also be keen to get their hands on this one. The interior follows a traditional floor plan boasting generous dimensions and period details to excite renovators with plenty of land to extend or incorporate alfresco entertaining. Alternatively, new home sites rarely present this much potential. Offered for the first time in 60 years, it's an opportunity not to be missed. Any structural changes resulting from above named options are of course subject to council approval.","SOLD - $1,480,000","2
