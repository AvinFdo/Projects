Sitting proudly on 640sqm approx. block of land is everything you've been looking for!
Featuring 4 large bedrooms (Master with en-suite and walk in robe) as well as an extra room for either a study or 5th bedroom. When entering the home you're greeted by a neat entryway with the master to the right and HUGE living zone to the left. Saying the living area is HUGE is somewhat of an understatement!

Separating the two living zones is a unique yet practical open fireplace that gives the ultimate ambiance throughout the winter! Although, if you're not one for lighting the fire the home is conveniently fitted with evaporative cooling and gas ducted heating assuring year round comfort! The home is also fitted with solar panels to ensure power bills remain low.
Out back is a lovely decked area amongst the yard we all wish we still had with plenty of space for your family and pets to play!
With all the above inclusions you wouldn't expect to be located in such close proximity to parks, multiple major shopping centres, schools (both primary and secondary) and easy access to both Cranbourne train station & Merinda Park train station!
Be quick to inspect as this property will not last long. So call Vikram on 0430392918 or Ajay on 0403351577 for further details.
