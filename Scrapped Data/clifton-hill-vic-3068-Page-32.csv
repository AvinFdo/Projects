clifton-hill-vic-3068,28 Page Street CLIFTON HILL VIC 3068,"EXCEPTIONALLY SPACIOUS, AND SO WELL LOCATED!
Generously proportioned rooms, a well-designed three bedroom layout and a prime cul de sac position just around the corner from the Darling Gardens give this town residence a very special appeal. A covered entry opens to a wide hallway, from which run a full-size laundry and WC, and a walk-in understair storage area. Set across the rear of the ground level is the kitchen -- well-equipped with quality stainless steel appliances, ample storage and soft-touch drawers – open to a sunny dining room with a wall of glass to the deep north-facing courtyard garden.
To the rear of the central level is the living room, spacious by any standard, with lots of northerly light. A hallway connects it to the main bedroom, a smart bathroom with bath and shower recess, and a separate toilet. Two further double bedrooms, both with high ceilings and storage, and one with stunning views over Clifton Hill to the CBD, occupy the upper level.
Among the many features of this welcoming property are recycled jarrah floorboards, reverse cycle air conditioning and gas heating throughout, abundant storage space, and covered parking adjacent to the entrance. The location could hardly be bettered – at the city end of Clifton Hill, within easy walking distance to tram and train transport, Queens Parade cafes and shopping, and Gold Street Primary School.

clifton-hill-vic-3068,50 O'Grady Street CLIFTON HILL VIC 3068,"A GREAT START, A TOP ADDRESS!
This light-filled period residence (ca 1919), in sound refurbished condition, has exciting potential for further renovation and extension (STCA) in the quiet central section of this popular street, so close to Yarra Parkland, city train, primary school and Clifton Hill Village.
An entry porch with fretwork arch opens to a hallway floored in polished timber, leading to two spacious bedrooms - the main with a bay window looking over the neat cottage garden, both with walls of quality built-in wardrobes. The well-proportioned living and dining room is equipped with a Cannon gas log fire. To the rear of the house are a functional modern kitchen, a newly fitted bathroom with timber cabinetry, a sunroom, laundry and separate WC. The landscaped north-facing garden, shaded by a mature magnolia, contains an intriguing relic of the area's history - a neat gabled workshop/utility room, one of several erected in O'Grady Street during World War II to provide accommodation for servicemen on leave.
