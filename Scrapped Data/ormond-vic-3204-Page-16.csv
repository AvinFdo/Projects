Set in 660sqm approx. of lush established gardens with a north facing BBQ retreat, pergola-shaded alfresco entertaining and a large workshop/studio at the rear, this fine family home enhances the easy life with ducted heating and evaporative cooling, a skylit study alcove, touch open cabinetry, easy access to under-stair storage plus outdoor shed and a large carport beyond off street parking.
Best of all, there's an in-demand, easy living location with all you need in close proximity - around the corner from North Road shops and station, a walk to Ormond Primary and Wattle Grove Reserve, minutes to McKinnon Village and Cosmopolitan Centre Road and Bayside's quick commute.

ormond-vic-3204,274 Grange Road Ormond VIC 3204,"Pretty as a picture
Possibly the prettiest home in the area, this beauty is presented to please. What a delight it is from the street, with its period charm, its impeccably maintained garden and its appealingly painted exterior. An entrance hall welcomes you in to an abode that definitely has that “home sweet home” ambience. Buffed and polished to a shine it has an entrance hall off which is the master bedroom where there is a box bay window (with plantation shutters), a mirror-fronted built-in wardrobe and an open fireplace (that can be hooked up to mains gas.) Both the second and third bedrooms also have BIRs. The bright bathroom features a clawfoot bath. French doors open to the side garden from the comfortable lounge room, which has a gas open fireplace. The kitchen (with stainless steel appliances and a gas cooktop) is adjacent to the dining area leading into a family room (with cathedral ceiling) and then seamlessly to the outdoor entertaining area that is fully covered and paved. It's a marvellous private party space with room for a BBQ and a large crowd of friends. Security alarm, ducted evaporative cooling, a 2nd toilet in the laundry, a reverse-cycle A/C, and a garage (accessed off Holloway Street) with automatic doors at both ends are included in this delightful property. On the corner of Holloway Street, the property sits on a compact, low maintenance allotment and is on the bus route, close to Ormond shops, cafes, trains and buses, near reserves, parks, recreation, schools, and convenient to Monash Uni (Caulfield).

ormond-vic-3204,43 Murray Road Ormond VIC 3204,"Sitting Pretty in the McKinnon Secondary Zone
A warm and inviting family home blessed with delightful period character, charming formal spaces, quiet reflective places and the good grace to be located not only next to Ormond Primary but also within the McKinnon Secondary zone. Period appeal comes in the form of delicate leadlight, fetching parquetry, a magnificent marble fireplace, a classically themed ensuite to the restful master and the wonderful country style kitchen featuring timeless timber cabinetry, an integrated Liebherr refrigerator and a very impressive Rayburn Royal gas-fired, free-standing stove. Step out for covered outdoor entertaining on an extensive brick paved patio or otherwise find solace on a very special private verandah off the second bedroom, in the deep spa bath in the main bathroom, maybe in the sunroom style studio/study or simply sunning yourself in the north facing lawned garden. A third bedroom is blissfully zoned off, cosy up around a Jetmaster fire and appreciate ducted heating, evaporative cooling and plenty of room for the cars including a single garage, a carport for two and further parking beyond. You may even like to add your personal touch to this very pretty original sitting within attractive garden surrounds, only a walk to the fabulous McKinnon and North Road shopping strips and therefore Ormond and McKinnon stations as well.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"3

Superbly renovated to give a contemporary edge to period beauty, this home is picture perfect, inside and out. What an appealing sight it makes from the street and what a big “wow” it earns for its stunning interior. From the wide planked floorboards to the bright white paintwork, from the high ceilings to the stylish presentation, from the generously proportioned rooms to the modern finishes and fittings, this is an outstanding home. The elegant formal lounge room is a great place for entertaining, as is the large open family room (split-system A/C)), which is awash with natural light and incorporates a brilliant kitchen with extensive use of Caesarstone, stainless steel Miele appliances, soft close drawers, and a breakfast bar. The outlook is to the private rear garden and outdoor entertaining area. The huge master bedroom (BIRs; window seat in bay window; ceiling fan) has a glamorous fully tiled ensuite. Two more bedrooms have BIRs and there is another chic bathroom, plus a large laundry. Among the extras are security alarm; approx 12sqm of storage in the ceiling above the laundry; shed; ducted heating; and 2-car carport. But that's not all - there's also a charming self-contained 1-bedroom bungalow, ideal for guest/in-law accommodation. The central location is in walking distance to the train station, buses, shops and cafes, with a reserve at the end of the street and recreational facilities, Kilvington and parks nearby.

Individually street-addressed directly opposite McKinnon Primary School, this freestanding four bedroom, 2.5 bathroom, dual zone home offers the perfect family plan with formal living-dining facing a decked central courtyard, an expansive family zone opening to an extra-large north-facing paved courtyard, a first-floor master-suite (with WIR and ensuite)...even a bonus balconied area to fit a study nook!
