cranbourne-vic-3977,2/2 William Street Cranbourne VIC 3977,"AN UPDATED 2 BEDROOM STREET FRONT UNIT IN CENTRAL CRANBOURNE
For a first home buyer looking to break into the market or an investor looking for areas on the rise, this vastly improved street front unit offers so much. In central position opposite Cranbourne Park Primary School and within minutes of Cranbourne train station, a great location is only the beginning. With a larger block than many units, it offers a low maintenance nature and has been significantly updated in the last year meaning its new owner can simply move and enjoy or rent it out with ease. Behind its classic brick façade you find a light filled home with tiles enhancing the lounge room with gas heater and split system air conditioner as well as a meals area adjoining the renovated kitchen with stainless steel appliances. There are 2 bedrooms with built in wardrobes as well as a family bathroom that has been updated along with the separate toilet and laundry. Outside, the north facing courtyard is both large and easy to care for while car accommodation is great too with single garage and room to park an extra car or 2 in the driveway.
