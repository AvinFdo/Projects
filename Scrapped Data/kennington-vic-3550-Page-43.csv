With the shortage of land and demand for builders at an all time high in the region, why bother waiting when this beautiful established family home is ready to walk straight into and enjoy immediately! Perched on the high side of the road in a quiet family friendly pocket of Maiden Gully, the immaculately presented, modern home ticks all your desired boxes, and has a little something for everyone to enjoy! Add to this a fully manicured and landscaped 899m2 allotment, you are well on your way to securing your family's future!
Built in 2011, the extra spacious floor plan offers over 33 squares under roof, including 25+ of comfortable and flexible living. Boasting up to 5 large bedrooms (or four plus large study/home office), spacious master with full ensuite and his ""n"" hers walk in robe. A second bathroom and toilet service the remaining household. Living space is a design feature of the home, with two huge areas allowing space to spread out. The open plan section at the centre of the home encompasses the kitchen and sizeable dining area which will house the largest of dinner or celebratory gatherings. The well equipped kitchen is complete with an good cupboard and bench space, stone bench tops, pantry, and all the modern appliances inc. 900mm cooking facilities and dishwasher. Other notable features include ducted heating and cooling throughout, 3.2kw solar panel system, ducted vacuuming system, plenty of storage space and a double garage with auto door and mud room section.
Outside, there has been some serious time and dollars spent for you to relax, entertain and enjoy the outdoors!

Private and sheltered from all the elements, just pick your spot depending on what time of year it is! The sparkling solar heated in-ground swimming pool will provide hours of entertainment for the kids and adults alike.

With all that + more, it leaves quite a big footprint on your block.

Presentation is immaculate, the home is in excellent order, and the location convenient to primary and secondary schools and the local supermarket! You could not build and establish this for the asking price, so call now to inspect and avoid the stress of trying!","SOLD - $642,500","4

kennington-vic-3550,803 Strathfieldsaye Road Strathfieldsaye VIC 3551,"Timeless 80's Classic
First impressions of this 1980s home will instantly leave you with an appreciation of the architecture and design of this era. Strong, bold brickwork being one of the many features throughout that remains timeless and beautiful. The transformation from past to present has seen some aspects of the original home remain the same whilst other areas have been revamped to meet the needs of modern day living. Sleek lighting design, stylish window furnishings and floor coverings are additions that create this modern tone through the open living area. The centre piece of the family hub is the sold brick mantle with wood fire heater, so warming and welcoming.
Spaciously designed, all bedrooms are generous and quite luxurious. Up to 3 children's bedrooms share a common Bathroom while the large Master suite extends to a full size en-suite. The original formal dining room is currently being utilised as the 4th bedroom.
True to the era, the Kitchen displays organisation with an abundance of cupboards, drawers and storage space. Timeless in presentation, the well-equipped work space features tiled splash backs, electric wall oven & hotplates, range hood, DW and concealed breakfast pantry, all considered to be quality items in a well-appointed kitchen of its time.
However, it is really the location and the lifestyle this property offers you that is most appealing. Set on 5047 sqm this includes - fenced paddock at the rear for pets or livestock, 6mx6m workshop/garage with concrete floor & power. Enclosed outdoor entertaining areas, large open spaces, side access and room to accommodate a caravan, boat or trailer. Being only 25 mins to Lake Eppalock, you can spend weekends enjoying your favourite water sports or a spot of fishing by the lake. Operate your business from home and create a work-life balance - the purpose-built study with built in shelving/work benches and cupboards is ideal in this Covid environment.
With future plans for development and subdivision of property nearby (STCA) , your investment here will continue to increase of in the future. With an excellent tenant currently in place and a return of $400 pw,( with vacant possession available) now is the time to reconsider your options and make the break from the city to the country.
