corio-vic-3214,16 Glendye Court Corio VIC 3214,"A Treat For The Eye On Glendye!
Situated in a quiet court here is a wonderful opportunity to secure a large family home featuring two internal living areas, a covered outdoor living area and the four well sized bedrooms that will never be outgrown. A tasteful colour palette is present throughout with quality kitchen cabinetry in good condition that will no doubt impress on inspection.
The master bedroom with ensuite is located at the front of the house - tastefully separated from the remaining three bedrooms positioned at the rear. The north facing rear yard and large covered deck/outdoor living area will be perfect for summer, entertaining family and friends.
A shed is also in the rear yard handy for storage and potential workshop area. Two covered car spots are secure behind a roller door while a carport carries across the front for quick and easy day to day access.
Gas heater wall units keep the living areas toasty during the winter months while evaporative cooling and ceiling fans accommodate the warmer summer days. With the home taking up most of the 559m2 block, here is an extensive floor plan that definitely wasn't ""cheaply built"" from conception. Be quick for this one!","SOLD - $450,500","4
