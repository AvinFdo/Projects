croydon-north-vic-3136,13 Durang Court Croydon North VIC 3136,"Best Value in Croydon North!
Some exciting news on this property. The owner just installed some brand new carpets. As this property was rented for some time, once the tenants moved out we could see some areas where the carpet was starting to show its age. So being a very pro active and motivated seller, the owner went out and purchased brand new carpets and had them installed.
So what do you get now? Well you get one of the best value three bedroom homes in Croydon North.
Complete with two living areas, ensuite bathroom, gas ducted heating and air conditioning, this home is just ideal for the first home buyer or savvy investor.
Schools, shops and amenities surround this area of Croydon North and McAdam Square is mere minutes away and even better, there is a milk bar within walking distance for that dash for milk or the Saturday morning papers.
Set to go to Public Auction on the 7th of July we have an owner who has given us very clear instruction to sell this and we will be conducting this Auction with a realistic reserve and instructions to put a deal together on the day.
Set on a corner block of 647m2 with double gates providing rear access and a double carport for the cars, this has to be one of the best value buys in Croydon North right now. Don’t delay, get on the phone and if you haven’t seen it yet book your inspection.
