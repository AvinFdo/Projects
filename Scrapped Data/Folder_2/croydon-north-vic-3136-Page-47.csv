croydon-north-vic-3136,7 Bronte Court Croydon North VIC 3136,"Peace, Home & Harmony
Set in the exclusive and tightly-held Bronte Court with views across to Hochkins Ridge Flora Reserve, this beautiful home offers a lifestyle that caters perfectly to the multi-generational family with its thoughtfully designed floor plan.
From the outset, the home presents beautifully, seamlessly divided into a primary and secondary residence. Manicured gardens, grand facade and a pristine interior with fine finishes including parquetry, fresh wool carpets, tiles, lined curtains and sheer lace. The living areas – the lounge/dining room, family zone – revolve around the central kitchen with quality appliances and an abundance of cupboard space. The 3 bedrooms are zoned privately upstairs (study downstairs), all with built-in robes, the large main bedroom with en suite, spa, walk-in-robe and additional air-conditioner. Extra incentives include a powder room for guests, fantastic timber deck with tranquil garden views (storage area beneath), ducted heating, evaporative cooling and double garage.
The secondary residence provides a generous living area, 2 bedrooms, bathroom with double shower and safety railing, sunny modern kitchen that looks out over the large backyard with exquisite gardens and covered outdoor entertaining. There is also a timber deck exclusive to this part of the home. It is the ideal scenario, ensuring both a sense of independence and family inclusion with separate entrance and garage with internal access.
The peaceful ambience of the location is exceptional. It is rare to find a home for sale in this tranquil cul-de-sac, and is, therefore, a particularly warm and friendly place to live with a Christmas street party held each year. Being Croydon North, there are a number of quality schools at your disposal: Luther College, Oxley College, Yarra Road Primary, Yarra Valley Grammar and Croydon North Primary. Similarly, there are several shopping precincts within close proximity: Chirnside Park, Eastland, Macadam Square and Croydon Centro to name a few. Within minutes are the rolling hills of the Yarra Valley and a huge array of boutique and mainstream wineries.
Peaceful location. Wonderful home. Harmonious family living.","SOLD - $625,000","5
