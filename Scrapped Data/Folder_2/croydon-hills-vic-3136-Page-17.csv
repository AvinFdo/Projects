croydon-hills-vic-3136,53 ANGELICA CRESCENT CROYDON HILLS VIC 3136,"The Centre of Attention
OPEN HOME CANCELLED
Saturday 21/6/2014
You will be the centre of attention as you set your eyes on this beautiful single level brick veneer family home that is located in the heart of the highly sought after and popular Croydon Hills estate.
The home has wonderful street presence and sits proudly on an almost flat 1/4 acre block that offers you 4 good sized robed bedrooms, the main has a walk through dressing room and full ensuite.
The large formal entry will lead you to the living areas, starting with the spacious lounge room at the front with beautiful cedar lined vaulted ceilings and warm cosy wood fire that will be ideal on those cold winter nights curled up reading a good book sipping on hot chocolate.
Special occasions like Birthday Dinners and Christmas can be accommodated easily in the formal dining room that takes in picturesque views over the side gardens.
The family room at the back has plenty of space for the family to relax, watch TV and still have enough room for everyday casual dining.
The gourmet kitchen is well appointed with quality Miele appliances, induction cook top and dishwasher along with loads of cupboard and bench space to ensure the chef of the family makes their kitchen rule at any meal time.
Before we take in what outside has to offer we mustn't forget other internal features such as gas ducted heating, wood fire, air conditioning, main bathroom, separate shower room, separate toilet, high ceilings, ducted vacuum, light filled interiors with soft subtle colours and tones.
Moving out from the family room you will discover the expansive and private undercover entertaining area that will be the perfect spot for family gatherings, parties, casual BBQ's, a cool afternoon drink or a leisurely weekend breakfast with a coffee and the paper, all whilst taking in the sights of native bird life fluttering away in the well established gardens and tranquil soothing sounds of the water feature bubbling away in the background.
The large fully fenced yard will be an absolute haven for children and pets to play safely under the watchful eye of Mum and Dad from either the entertaining area or the kitchen window.
The handy person of the home will be spoiled with the over sized double garage that has plenty of room for a workshop, circular driveway with automatic gates, plus extra parking room for family and visitor cars, boats, trailers or caravans.
All this is close to Yarra Valley Grammar, Luther College, respected primary schools, shops, parkland's and walking tracks.
There are so many other features this home has to experience, so be quick and book your viewing today.","SOLD - $625,000","4
