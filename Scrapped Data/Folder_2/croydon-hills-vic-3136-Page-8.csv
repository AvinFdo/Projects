Beautiful living with a backyard oasis
On the high side of the street, close to parklands and lakes, this fully renovated family home boasts a fluid, single-storey floorplan and a peaceful backyard oasis featuring a resort-style saltwater pool and spa, accompanied by a studio/pavilion with a bathroom.
Vaulted ceilings with clerestory windows grace the sunken, fireside lounge, adjoining an open study at the front of the house. Stainless steel Blanco cooking appliances, an Asko dishwasher, Caesarstone countertops and soft-close cabinetry are highlights of the gourmet kitchen, overlooking a tiled dining area and a family room, both accessing an alfresco BBQ terrace.
Freshly painted interior and lush brand-new carpets complement the further inclusions of gas ducted heating, evaporative cooling and a double carport with an automatic roller door. The backyard studio/pavilion would make an ideal home office or potentially teenage accommodation, given the home's proximity to Yarra Valley Grammar, the Rudolf Steiner School, Luther College, McAdam Square and a selection of primary schools.
