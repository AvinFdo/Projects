croydon-vic-3136,3/155 Lincoln Road Croydon VIC 3136,"A Love Affair That Keeps Giving. Simply Spectacular!
Fusing together low upkeep townhouse living and a central location, close to Mooroolbark and Croydons shopping and transport facilities. This quietly positioned double storey is only two years old with a stylish and functional footprint and is well designed for couples, families and for empty nesters who want all the creature comforts they're used to. Not a stone unturned, the open plan environment with Tasmanian Oak floors pays tribute to plenty of natural sunlight, access to the alfresco deck outside and maintains a social connect with the kitchen which is meticulously staged with a Caesar stone waterfall bench top, a six burner stove, feature overhead pendant lights and subway tiles. The ground floor also accommodates the master bedroom and spa-like ensuite which mirrors the family bathroom on the first floor where the other two bedrooms, study and retreat are found. Feature lighting is a highlight throughout the home, along with evaporative and split AC, ducted heating and a double garage.","SOLD - $650,000","3
