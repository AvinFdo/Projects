drysdale-vic-3222,152-156 Wyndham Street Drysdale VIC 3222,"Expansive Family Home With Huge Triple Garage - On A Landscaped 2 Acres!
Phone Enquiry ID:44440
An expansive family home on a superb, beautifully landscaped 2 acres (8000sqm) right in the heart of Drysdale, perfect for families of any configuration and throughout all stages of life. Just moments from all amenities, yet surrounded by other small acreages with plenty of space in between.
This beautiful, quality-built home is immaculately presented with a long list of features. An exceptional opportunity to acquire an expansive, premium home along with the relaxed, carefree country-meets-surf-coast lifestyle that only the Bellarine Peninsula can offer!
If you’ve given up hope that you’ll ever find a small, centrally located acreage with a ready-made home that can accommodate all the cars, the weekend toys and your tools, as well as enough internal living space to complement, you may have to sit down…. The home and lifestyle you’re looking for actually does exist!
Four large bedrooms, or three plus an office and two bathrooms - impressive Master suite with walk-in robe and ensuite. A beautiful timber kitchen at the heart, surrounded by extra-large formal and informal living and dining zones with north-facing windows allowing abundant natural light to trickle in.
A wide veranda skirts around three sides with beautiful rural outlooks over the gardens to the paddocks behind - and the handyman, car or watersport enthusiast will love the huge 10m x 8m triple rautomatic garage and workshop!
The location is paramount, to say the very least. Just 1km to Drysdale PO, within minutes from an array of quality schooling options, 10 minutes (10km) to Ocean Grove and Point Lonsdale’s surf beaches, 20km to Central Geelong, 15 mins to historic Queenscliff and Queenscliff-Mornington ferry.
Perhaps best of all, Melbourne professionals can say goodbye to their 2-3 hour heavy-traffic commute, and say hello to a relaxed, 12 minute country drive to the Port Phillip Ferry terminal; where they can either enjoy the glorious bay views - instead of tail lights; catch up on the latest news or get a headstart on the day’s workload!
FEATURES:
- Gas ducted heating throughout
- Split system air-conditioning
- Back-to-base security system
- 20,000ltr water tank (and connected to town water)
- Immaculately looked after, quality-built home","SOLD - $875,000","3
