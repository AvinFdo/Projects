PRIVATE INSPECTIONS AVAILABLE - BY APPOINTMENT ONLY
Presented as new and positioned in a sought-after walk-everywhere location, this single level home will leave you with nothing more to do than enjoy the lifestyle or the rental income

Filled with natural light, it integrates a well laid out kitchen finished in timeless black and white and featuring quality stainless steel appliances, and opens to a sizeable rear yard, ready for your alfresco input.
The bedroom includes plenty of robe space, and in a well thought out bonus, the bathroom is adjacentmeaning guests don't need to traipse through your bedroom to use it.
An easy walk to Epping Plaza and all the benefits that bring High Street's eateries are even closer, and the station and Greenbrook Village are both within a stress-free stroll! The car park on title will come in very handy!
• Timber floors
• Split system climate control unit
