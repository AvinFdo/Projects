croydon-hills-vic-3136,38 Jull Parade Ringwood North VIC 3134,"Family haven with park views.
This lovingly cared for and meticulously maintained home in a much sought after area in Ringwood North is being reluctantly put on the market by its adoring owners. Just a very short walk to North Ringwood shops, a multitude of primary and secondary schools, public transport and backing onto the picturesque Mahon Reserve which is perfect for the family footy or cricket games, this home has it all. Features included 4 double bedrooms all with built in robes, master with full ensuite that has been updated complete with stone benchtops, new heated towel rack and toilet, formal lounge and dining, centrally located kitchen which has also been updated with Bosch appliances, ample cupboard space and pantry cupboard with fitted shelving to maximise space. The family rumpus room is perfectly placed with its cosy gas log fire with this room flowing directly onto fully covered rear patio where you can sit and entertain, cook on the BBQ while watching the kids playing either in the back yard or in Mahon Reserve which is accessed by the gate in the rear fence. For added comfort there is gas ducted heating and ducted evaporative cooling throughout, plus refrigerated cooling, ceiling fans for circulation, double carport, twin storage areas both under the house and the decking with back up from the garden shed. A brick paved path that goes entirely around the home and forming another outdoor entertaining zone at the foot of the patio. The floor plan of this home shows the formal living and dining areas are separated from the family/casual dining and living but linked by the entry hall and kitchen to form an excellent combined entertaining zone which flows onto the elevated covered back deck and lower brick paved BBQ area. Great for parties. The vendors will be sorry to leave their neighbours with friendships that have formed over many years. This is a wonderful opportunity for someone new to bring up their family in this great family home.","SOLD - $978,000","4
