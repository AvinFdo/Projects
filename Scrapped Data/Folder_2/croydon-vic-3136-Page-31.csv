This popular, leafy pocket offers up an enviable lifestyle with this spacious four-bedroom home. Well positioned close to McAdam Square Shopping Centre, The Good Shepherd Lutheran Primary School, Luther College and Yarra Valley Grammar, this residence promises to immerse the occupants in quality appointments and embracive convenience.
Poised on a well-maintained corner allotment and boasting striking street appeal, the home welcomes you in with a stylish return verandah and charming gables that harmonise perfectly with the landscaped garden.

Inspiring and restful, three separate living zones are perfectly able to deliver highly functional, relaxed and sophisticated spaces to enjoy, beginning with the formal lounge/dining showcasing a box bay window.
The home pays attention to everyday ease and entertaining and it all begins in the kitchen, featuring an electric wall oven, electric stove, integrated dishwasher, a blend of cupboards and drawers in addition to a breakfast bar, servery and adjoining casual meals/family area leading outdoors to the side verandah. Adding further space, the separate rumpus enjoys a leafy outlook through large windows, in addition to direct access to the secure rear yard (perfect for a boat, caravan or tradesman access) where a paved entertaining area will host many guests.
The master is positioned away from the other bedrooms for privacy and features twin double built-in robes, ceiling fan and full ensuite with shower, large vanity and skylight. A quiet hallway leads invitingly to three well-proportioned bedrooms comprising double built-in robes and a tiled bathroom incorporating a separate shower, bath and adjoining toilet.
Occupying a 659m2 (approx.) block, enhanced comfort and inclusions include; large tiled laundry with storage, gas ducted heating, evaporative cooling, carpet and tiles throughout, quality window furnishings, double gates to secure backyard and remote double garage with access to rear. The home's interior has also been recently painted, as well as the addition of a new drive and pathway.

This quietly positioned double storey is only two years old with a stylish and functional footprint and is well designed for couples, families and for empty nesters who want all the creature comforts they're used to. Not a stone unturned, the open plan environment with Tasmanian Oak floors pays tribute to plenty of natural sunlight, access to the alfresco deck outside and maintains a social connect with the kitchen which is meticulously staged with a Caesar stone waterfall bench top, a six burner stove, feature overhead pendant lights and subway tiles. The ground floor also accommodates the master bedroom and spa-like ensuite which mirrors the family bathroom on the first floor where the other two bedrooms, study and retreat are found. Feature lighting is a highlight throughout the home, along with evaporative and split AC, ducted heating and a double garage.","SOLD - $650,000","3
