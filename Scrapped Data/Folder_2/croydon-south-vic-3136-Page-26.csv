croydon-south-vic-3136,4 Camelia Court CROYDON SOUTH VIC 3136,"A Tintern Treasure
Sale by Negotiation
It is easy to think you have walked into a botanic wonderland, such is the picturesque nature of this picture-perfect single-level home, nestled in a secluded cul de sac that's tailor made for raising the growing family.
The home's warm and inviting interior takes its cues from its nature-inspired surroundings, with a light colour scheme combining with radiant living areas and timber floors underfoot to create a relaxing, natural feel.
Fend off this chilly nights by rugging up in front of the magnificent open fireplace in the expansive central living area, which seamlessly blends the dining, family living and standout kitchen as one.
An additional living area at the top of the spacious, flowing layout enjoys plenty of privacy, yet such is its versatility that the kids can claim it as a games retreat of their own. However, there's a very good chance those working from home will be enticed to take advantage of its scenic outlook towards the manicured backyard (which includes a paved outdoor setting) and use the area as a serene home office.
All bedrooms benefit from their seclusion from the main living areas, generous proportions and built-in robes, while those who love to cook will relish in a stylish kitchen that boasts stainless steel appliances, loads of bench space, easy-to-clean splashback and plenty of storage for those pots and pans!
The defining feature of this impressive home, however, resides outside where a spectacular display of meticulously landscaped gardens - designed by renowned Nurseryman, Andrew Smith - envelope the home in unsurpassed beauty and tranquility.
Security alarm plus split-system heating and cooling offers modern comfort, while convenience for the modern family is delivered in a location that's within the Tintern pocket and only minutes away from Ringwood East train station, major hospitals, Eastland Shopping Centre and scenic parkland.
