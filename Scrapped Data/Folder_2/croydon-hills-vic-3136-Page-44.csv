croydon-hills-vic-3136,U15/18-20 Louisa Street Croydon VIC 3136,"NEW PRICE - Modern, Neat and Fresh
This beautiful single level unit is modern, neat and fresh and sure to appeal to those buyers looking for their 1st home, singles, couples, young families, downsizes or investors.
Nestled at the back of the complex, the unit offers you a spacious floor plan that consists of 2 good sized robed bedrooms, the main at the front takes in views to the garden and is complemented by a walk in robe and ensuite effect bathroom.
The 2 living areas are designed with modern living in mind. The open plan flows from the kitchen with the family meals area then to the living room that views over the backyard and patio.
The centrally located kitchen is well equipped with plenty of cupboards, bench space and dishwasher to ensure the chef of the family makes their kitchen rule for any meal occasion.
Before we take in the outdoors, we mustn't forget other internal features which include gas ducted heating, split system air conditioning, main bathroom with separate toilet, large laundry room, plenty of storage, brand new carpets throughout, new blinds and window furnishings, freshly painted through out in a neutral crisp white and with an abundance of natural light.
Entertaining is made easy in 2 outdoor areas. The courtyard off the kitchen and hallway will be ideal for leisurely weekend breakfasts with a coffee and the paper, whilst the back patio will be perfect for family gatherings, casual BBQ's, alfresco dining or cool afternoon drinks.
Car accommodation is well taken care of in the garage with remote controlled door plus there is internal access to the home.
All this is within a close distance to Churinga Village Shopping Centre that has Coles, Woolworths and Aldi, schools, transport, walking tracks, parklands and easy access to Mt Dandenong Road that takes you through to Croydon, Ringwood, Eastland and Eastlink.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"2
