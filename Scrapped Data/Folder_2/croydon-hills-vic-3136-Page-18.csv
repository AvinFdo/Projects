croydon-hills-vic-3136,2 Dargo Close CROYDON HILLS VIC 3136,"FAMILY ZONE
The perfect balance of lifestyle and convenience is hard to find, not to mention a location that fits in with the needs of children and adults alike. So when a home that passes all the tests comes along, it's time to take advantage!
Ideally positioned on 661m2 (approx.), nearby to a selection of brilliant schools, including Croydon Hills Primary, Luther College, The Good Shepherd Primary and to Yarra Valley Grammar, catering for children couldn't come easier. McAdam Square shops, cafes and the local bus services create convenience, with Croydon Main Street a short commute away, together with access to Eastlink.
The three bedroom home is exceptionally presented, with robes in all the bedrooms, an en suite and family bathroom, a spacious lounge and dining room, as well as a casual family zone, meals area and spotless kitchen, staged with a stainless dishwasher, wall oven and gas cook top.
A semi detached studio creates a whole other dimension, opening up the option to run a small business from home, or to utilize the room as a private art studio, study or teen retreat. And with access through the secured double carport, the potential to run a home based office becomes even more appealing.
Positioned on a prime corner block, the home also features outdoor entertaining, a beautiful garden behind a picket fence, as well as comforting inclusions like ducted heating and air conditioning.","SOLD - $490,000","3

croydon-hills-vic-3136,10 Tanya Court CROYDON HILLS VIC 3136,"A Perfect 10 For The Grand Entertainer
Sale by Negotiation
An entertainer's dream is perhaps the most apt way to describe this tastefully renovated four-bedroom home.
Nestled at the top of a quiet court setting that offers convenient access to surrounding parkland, the best private schools in the area and local shops.
The grand entertainer at heart will be in their element, playing host to summertime BBQ's beneath the sensational outdoor entertaining area, decked underfoot, sheltered above and designed for large gatherings. Add to the mix; Foxtel-ready connection points for a TV and a six-seater, gas-heated spa; the perfect mix of man-cave readiness and long indulgent alfresco lunches.
The laundry, kitchen and bathrooms have all been renovated over the past two years, while the interior is styled with polished timber floorboards and freshly painted with contemporary tones, meaning there's absolutely nothing left for you to do but move in and enjoy the trendy lifestyle on offer.
A sleek kitchen at the top of the floorplan offers plenty of space for cooks with a fashionable arrangement of quality European stainless steel appliances, modern cabinetry and easy-to-clean glass splashback.
Those who cherish their privacy will appreciate the higher than average fences, and if kids are present, the mature trees shading the grassed lawn.
In fact every room of this well-positioned home feels secluded with abundant garden views.
Boasting three generous sized robed-bedrooms and a study or fourth bedroom, and impressive master suite with enough room for a sitting area, all successfully separated from the vibrant heart of the home.
While the presence of gas ducted heating and evaporative cooling ensures perfect climate levels all year round.
Have a trailor or a jet-ski?
Drive-through garage provides safe storage, and if you need more space to store your tools, there's plenty of room alongside the garage to erect a sizeable shed.
Dog owners and families with children will certainly appreciate the walking distance access to five interconnecting parks, and the close proximity of Eastland Shopping Centre, transportation and Eastlink adds further appeal.
