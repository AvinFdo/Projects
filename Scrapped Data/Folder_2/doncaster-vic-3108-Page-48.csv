doncaster-vic-3108,503/7 Berkeley Street Doncaster VIC 3108,"Penthouse Living On Doncaster Hill!
Apartment is available to purchase fully furnished.
Instantly revealing the wow factor, this breathtaking two-bedroom penthouse apartment is the epitome of sleek sophistication and ultra-contemporary lock-and-leave living.
Presented in showroom condition with a superior level of quality and craftsmanship, you'll marvel at the polished timber floors that flow underfoot, gorgeous waterfall stone benches and stainless steel appliances of the gourmet kitchen and contemporary luxury of the main bathroom and Master ensuite.
You'll also love the manner in which the sun-kissed open-plan living expands onto the large entertainers' terrace, ideal for catching up with friends beneath a star-lit sky or escaping the daily grind with a coffee in hand. Although, living on the footsteps of Westfield Shoppingtown also means you can treat yourself to some retail therapy, indulge in a gourmet dining experience or watch a movie and totally disconnect from reality any time you need a little 'me time'.
Boasting incredible attention to detail, this exquisite residence enjoys the benefits of reverse-cycle air-conditioning and heating, secure underground carpark, security access and quick and easy access to the Eastern Freeway, schools, Manningham Art Gallery and parks.

Set on a substantial-sized 851sqm (approx.) allotment in the heart of Doncaster where Westfield Shoppingtown, Ruffey Lake Park, Schramms Reserve, Doncaster Secondary College and bus services are within walking distance and the Eastern Freeway is just minutes away, this potential-rich field of dreams lends itself perfectly to development purposes given its ability to comfortably accommodate a pair of ultra-contemporary Townhouses (STCA).

Impeccably well presented, this big and bright home is defined by its spacious nature, with segregated living areas on hand to cater for your growing family's needs. The elegant formal lounge and dining arrangement is one such living area that enjoys immaculate presentation with its wide contemporary timber floors and sun-kissed nature, while a carpeted family living that flows off the open-plan kitchen/meals area presents a fantastic space to unwind with the kids.
Clever zoning is another standout hallmark of the home, with well-proportioned bedrooms (Master with ensuite) and a large family bathroom secluded in privacy upstairs.
Climate controlled with evaporative cooling upstairs and ducted heating downstairs and complete with a paved outdoor entertaining area, grassed backyard and double garage with rear roller door, make your move in Doncaster's heart.","SOLD - $1,530,000","5

doncaster-vic-3108,306/8 Berkeley Street Doncaster VIC 3108,"Live Next To Shoppers Paradise
With both Westfield Doncaster and Doncaster Primary School less than a minute’s walk from the front door, the location of this large, top floor apartment is ideal if you love to shop and is absolutely perfect if you have primary school age children as well. Facing north with a full-width balcony soaking up the sun and bathing every room in natural light, this apartment includes a master bedroom which opens onto the balcony and has a big walk-in robe and fully tiled ensuite bathroom with frameless rain shower. The 2 additional double bedrooms have built-in robes and share another fully tiled bathroom also with frameless rain shower and discreet Euro style laundry facilities including a trough. The generously proportioned living room, which also opens onto the balcony, will easily accommodate a dining area and includes reverse cycle air conditioning and wired in speakers while the kitchen offers a full suite of Smeg appliances plus stone benchtops, soft close drawers, glass splashbacks and ample storage cabinetry. Features include 2 car spaces, video intercom security and communal gymnasium and swimming pool.
The close proximity to Westfield Doncaster is undeniably appealing for both owner-occupiers and investors as is the convenience of having Doncaster Primary School at the end of the street but further appeal is added by a choice of bus services just metres away including the city bound 907 service. Add to this the ease of access to the Eastern Freeway and other major arterials as well as Doncaster Park ‘n’ Ride, zoning for Doncaster Secondary College and being only minutes away from the huge choice of Asian restaurants in Box Hill and this property really demands your inspection.","SOLD - $670,000","3
