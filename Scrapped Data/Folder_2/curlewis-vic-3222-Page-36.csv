A beautifully appointed kitchen, contemporary appliances, custom cabinetry, expansive bench space and excellent storage solutions
A wonderfully light and bright primary living area; huge north facing window promotes an abundance of natural light an inviting space to take in a cup of tea and soak up the warmth from the morning sun
All the modern comforts; ducted heating/cooling, new carpets, freshly painted. Slate floors, timber decking, exposed aggregate drive-way and external blinds just to name a few of the fine inclusions
A prime land holding of 585m2 (approx) within a tranquil green leafy pocket of Clifton Springs completes a very pretty picture
As delightful as this home is, I personally believe that its impressive surrounds sets it apart from others in the market place; mature trees flank the boundaries creating a welcomed seclusion, productive veggie patches and selection of fruits trees, a family/pet friendly secure rear yard, rain water tanks, brick paved sheltered alfresco and an expansive garage and defined work shop.","SOLD - $450,000","3
