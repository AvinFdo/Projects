docklands-vic-3008,3001/90 Lorimer Street Docklands VIC 3008,"IMMACULATE SKY HOME
This immaculate sky-high apartment, in one of Docklands most striking towers, offers an escape from it all, up in the clouds.
The Mirvac T5 sits on the banks of the Yarra, across from ANZ’s headquarters and just as short walk from the unique Webb Bridge.
Pass through the stylishly minimal foyer and shoot upwards to the 30th floor, and it doesn’t take long to realize this property is something special. As you step over the threshold the wide, open-plan living space is revealed a rarity in such a modern apartment.
A palette of pale colour, from the luxurious carpets to the tall walls, creates the perfect blank canvas for any avid art collector to leave their mark.
There’s a wall of floor-to-ceiling windows and a sliding door accessing an expansive balcony, ensuring the property is flooded with natural light as the clouds roll by.
The galley-style kitchen sits to one side, with no shortage of stone bench tops to prepare a feast. Stainless steel Miele appliances are set among the cabinetry, adding to the effortless panache evident wherever you look.
The balcony itself is a real treat, turn left and you look down the spine of the Yarra out towards the Bolte Bridge standing proud in the distance and the observation wheel almost directly ahead.
Turn right and the entire city is laid out before you in a breathtaking panorama, with the Rialto and Eureka building standing sentinel. Far below, the boats moored at the marina look like a child’s toy. Spectacular would be an understatement.
The main bedroom demonstrates a dab hand with unique design flair. As you enter, a spacious walk-in wardrobe is tucked away just behind you.
An immaculate ensuite on the right is well-appointed and enveloped tiles. A deep spa-style bath sits before a huge glass wall, cleverly allowing you to gaze out towards the city while you soak away the cares of the worlds. More modest bathers may choose to roll down the blind.
On the other side of the property is a second bedroom with built-in mirrored wardrobes. You can lie in bed and see right out to the Dandenong’s.
Lucky residents can also take full advantage on the RekDek gym, heated lap pool, sauna and steam room. Throw two secure car spaces and a storage cage into the mix and you really are spoiled. It’s all about living the high life.
