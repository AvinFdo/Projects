Vibrant, manicured gardens bookend this 3 bedroom plus study/ fourth bedroom federation-style home made for families. Soft décor harmonises with luxuriously draped bay windows to create an upbeat, light-filled atmosphere. Featuring 2 separately zoned living areas, the layout divides the formal lounge and dining (replete with a built in TV and display cabinet and surround sound) from the casual meals and family room overseen by the well-equipped kitchen. Perfect family zoning places the spacious master (with walk-in robe and ensuite) at the front of the house and the remaining bedrooms and study at the other, allowing parents a veritable retreat. Outside, a verdant paradise awaits, catering for alfresco dining, entertaining and reclining. Established plantation skirts the fence line, creating absolute privacy, while a paved undercover outdoor living area is overseen by a built-in barbeque. The lawn, a perfect place for young imaginations to run wild, is punctuated by an elegant garden feature. Convenience is only a short stroll away courtesy of local shops, bus route and schools. Features: solid-wood cabinet with retractable doors, Tastic heating lights in bathrooms, spa bath, surround sound inside & out, alarm system, ducted vacuum, ducted heating, Breezaire air-conditioning, downlights, sprinkler system, double automatic garage.

The seamless presentation of this 3 bedroom abode is a warm welcome with plenty more to explore inside. With ducted heating and ducted air conditioning the lounge is a cosy space to lay about and catch up on your favourite TV programs or a perhaps a good book, with more everyday family living to be enjoyed in the open plan family, meals and kitchen which is complete with a gas oven/cook top and a dishwasher. There are 2 bathrooms to service the bedrooms; the family bathroom has been on the receiving end of a make-over , including a semi frameless shower and a stylish vanity. All the bedrooms have ideal storage space in their built in robes and are a generous size, even for growing teenagers. Also including ducted heating and ducted air conditioning. If you're after the wow factor, wait until you see the enormous indoor/outdoor living room. Constantina doors open out to invite the natural sunlight and fresh air in, and again close when the weather isn't so good. Powered and heated, this room is simply sensational! The surrounding gardens are delightful and include 2 work sheds and the convenience of a double carport. Just across the road, the kids play ground will keep the little ones entertained all day long, while nearby Croydon Main Street, transportation and local schools are all within easy reach.
