doncaster-vic-3108,22 Nathan Street Doncaster VIC 3108,"Live, invest or develop in the heart of Doncaster.
Here's your chance to make your mark in the heart of Doncaster with this potential-packed single-level home on a sensational 809.8sqm (approx.) block.
Boasting a coveted GRZ2/DDO8 zoning and within walking distance of schools, transport, Westfield Shoppingtown, Jackson Court shops and cafes and Ruffey Lake Park, a large-scale development opportunity in a five-star location is certainly on the cards for the buyer with vision (STCA).
Perfectly liveable and generously proportioned, there's also the option of moving straight into this fantastic four-bedroom home and deciding its fate later in the future.
Size and space are hallmarks of the radiant L-shaped lounge/dining area on entry, while the integration between the large open-plan meals/kitchen area and undercover outdoor area makes seamless indoor-outdoor entertaining possible.
Four bedrooms (master with-built in robes, split-system heating/cooling and ensuite) are of good proportions and serviced by a central family bathroom, while wonderful high ceilings, a neutral colour palette and polished timber floorboards are desirable assets.
The generous nature of the grassed backyard allows the kids to run and play outside for hours on end, and with an established vegetable garden present, you can teach them about the benefits of growing your own produce.
Climate-controlled with split-system heating/cooling and ducted heating, this fantastic investment and family upsizer also features secure off-street parking, abundant storage space, easy-care established gardens and swift access to the Eastern Freeway.","SOLD - $1,130,000","4
