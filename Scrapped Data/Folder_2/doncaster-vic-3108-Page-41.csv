doncaster-vic-3108,902/632 Doncaster Road Doncaster VIC 3108,"Pinnacle sub-penthouse living with three side-by-side car spaces!
Stand out from the crowd in more ways than one with this unique two-bedroom sub-penthouse that’s distinctly different from the rest inside the Doncaster Primary School and Doncaster Secondary College catchment area.
Presented as new and enjoying the prestige of a 9th floor position with a spectacular 180-degree panoramic view towards the Macedon Ranges, Melbourne airport, the CBD and Port Phillip Bay, it’s a view of perfection from this prized position on top of Doncaster Hill. And when you direct your attention inside this customised two-bedroom abode in the acclaimed Pinnacle apartment complex, you’ll quickly discover that the difference most certainly rests in the detail.
From extra lighting and power points to two-pack cabinets throughout and custom-made furnishings, careful consideration and impeccable attention to detail adorns every square of this upgraded residence. There’s also the generous offering of three basement car spaces, grouped together to offer a sizeable parking bay that’s envy of many!
Watch fireworks light up the night sky on New Year’s Eve from the spectacular entertaining terrace, which is fitted with louvres to offer protection against the elements. Those same views can also be savoured from the comfort of the radiant open-plan living and excellent master bedroom, designed with walk-through robes and ensuite.
Soft-closing drawers, Caesarstone benchtops, quality stainless steel appliances, feature lighting and a plumbed fridge space add style and functionality to the deluxe kitchen, while a private home office (with built-in shelving) at the front of the apartment is particularly beneficial for those running a business from home.
Abundant space and comfort defines the second bedroom that’s serviced by a central main bathroom (with Euro laundry), while video intercom, lift access, secure entry, electric blinds in the living area, an electric heating panel and split-system heating/cooling enhances the appeal of this feature-packed abode.
Add to the mix an unbeatable location where Westfield Shoppingtown and city-bound bus services are just across the road and the Eastern Freeway is around the corner and it’s easy to see why this is the pinnacle of lock-and-leave living in Manningham.","SOLD - $728,000","2

doncaster-vic-3108,1 Ebon Court Doncaster VIC 3108,"A north-facing corner delight with bright prospects for the future.
It's easy to imagine your young family living inside this captivating three-bedroom home, conveniently located in one of Doncaster's best pockets.
Boasting striking architectural elements where full-length windows maximise daylight use and enhance visual flow, its funky retro character is unique to itself and will certainly be treasured by anyone who's lucky enough to call this place home.
Set your eyes on the huge grassed backyard and immediately you'll try and identify where to build a cubby house for the kids. Walk through the sun-kissed lounge/dining and already feel yourself unwinding and relaxing after a hard day's work, with the aid of its open nature, timber touches and pleasant outlook towards the Box Hill skyline. Then stand in the bright kitchen (with stainless steel appliances) and think of all the meals you could create, and then enjoy out on the deck that comfortably caters for large gatherings.
You could update its well-maintained interior that also boasts warm timber floorboards, stunning high ceilings, gas ducted heating and split-system cooling, however there's no need to given the charm, character and fashionable attributes its funky retro persona delivers.
What isn't out of the question is the desire to capitalise on the outstanding 656sqm (approx.) north-facing corner block and build a collection of townhouses (STCA) in this first-class locale that's within walking distance of Birralee Primary School, Katrina St Reserve, the Koonung Creek Trail, Wilsons Rd Reserve and Park & Ride bus services and moments to Koonung Secondary College, the Eastern Freeway and Westfield","SOLD - $1,210,000","3

doncaster-vic-3108,73 Wilsons Road Doncaster VIC 3108,"Where the future is bright!
Sale By Set Date Tuesday 9th January at 6pm
Packed with potential within walking distance of the highly-regarded Birralee Primary School, Wilsons Rd Reserve, the Koonung Creek Trail and bus services that take you directly to the shopping, dining and entertainment Mecca that is Westfield Shoppingtown and CBD, this prized four-bedroom home will reward those with vision.
Sited on a large 654sqm block with a north-facing rear, it's an outstanding spot to develop a pair of brand new townhouses (STCA), and given the existing home also stands inside the Koonung Secondary College catchment area, there'll be temptation to move straight in and raise your young family in five-star surrounds.
Allow your creativity to shine through and update the original yet pristine interior now or in the future, or enjoy the current-day picture of space and comfort, along with a generous-sized formal lounge/dining area, sun-kissed kitchen (with stainless steel appliances) and radiant open-plan living area that connects with a large elevated outdoor entertaining area nestled amongst the treetops.
All four bedrooms are of generous proportions (master with two-way bathroom access), while a separate toilet, shower room, secure entry, split-system heating/cooling, plenty of off-street parking and swift access to the Eastern Freeway enhance the appeal of this smart investment.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"4
