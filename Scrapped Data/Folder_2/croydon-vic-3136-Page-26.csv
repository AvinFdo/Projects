Polished floorboards throughout, a neutral colour palette and high ceilings play up the feeling of space inside this incredibly well presented two-bedroom abode. Modernised a few years back, the upgrades are timeless and will appeal to the owner occupier who wants immediate comfort, or for the investor who wants a turn-key investment that is ready to rent straight away. Packing a lot of punch for such a space savvy home, the interior represents an upgraded kitchen with stone bench tops and a collection of Blanco, Westinghouse and Asko appliances, and the bathroom is well designed to service the single storey home. Mirrored built in robes, day/night blinds, three reverse cycle heating/AC units, a gas wall heater, an alarm, 8 solar panels, a single garage and a private rear deck are also featured throughout the home, and the convenience to Main Street and Arndale shops, the train station, Swinburne University and Aquahub gym is a valuable bonus.","SOLD - $535,000","2
