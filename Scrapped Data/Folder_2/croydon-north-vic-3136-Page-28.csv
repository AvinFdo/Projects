Character and Charm, Past and Present
Set privately amongst the majestic Eucalypts that define this idyllic pocket, this renovated and extended, original period home sits comfortably in its rustic setting. Positioned on a 939 sq m (approx.) corner allotment of a unique, tree-lined laneway that forms part of the historic Wicklow ridgeline.

Many years on, the adjacent open-plan kitchen/family/meals area offers the choice of a modern alternative with features including timber kitchen benchtops and Blanco appliances.
The main bedroom includes a WIR and ensuite. The 3 further bedrooms have BIRs and share the family bathroom, complete with its original cast iron claw-foot bath and large shower.
Additional features include laundry, lower level gym/utility space, separate home office/studio/teen retreat, 2 car auto garage/workshop, water tank and not forgetting the frequent visitation of local bird and wildlife.
Well positioned with easy access to the Croydon bus service, Luther College, Yarra Valley Grammar, primary schools, Eastlink and the new and improved Ringwood Station/Eastland precinct.
