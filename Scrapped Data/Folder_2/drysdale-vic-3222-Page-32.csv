drysdale-vic-3222,521-559 Murradoc Road DRYSDALE VIC 3222,"Blantyre"" - Productive acres between the Bays
Like its namesake in Scotland, meaning ""top of the land"", this property, sited between Corio Bay and Swan Bay and surrounded by beautiful rural vistas, is indeed 'tops'!
The property boasts 82 acres (approx) (33.12ha) of fertile ground and 3 dams, ideal for cropping or livestock and is bound by established shelter belts with glimpses of Swan Bay from the Victorian 3 bedroom homestead.
The driveway is lined with majestic gums and provides a welcoming approach. The charming porch takes you back in time setting the theme for the home's interior. Beautiful decor includes stained glass, iron lace, original tongue-and-groove wood panelling, timber windows and lofty ceilings.
The bedrooms are queen-sized, one with an original period-style open fireplace.
The central living and dining space is open plan and flooded with easterly sunlight. These windows capture wide countryside views framed by the iron lace of the adjoining veranda. Swan Bay glimpses linger on the horizon. A Rinnai gas heater assists comfort.
The galley-style kitchen is linked to the living/dining space via a servery, and features electric cooking appliances, spacious benches and good storage.
The wet area offers a shower, vanity and toilet.
Outhouses include a roomy bunkhouse, washhouse with 2nd toilet, vintage tractor shed for 2 vehicles, modern machinery shed for 3 vehicles and a hay shed.
Servicing the homestead is a 6800L water tank and a septic system.
Ripe for renovation, this home could be a rewarding project for those with a passion for restoration. Otherwise, the land provides ample room and a stunning rural setting for your ultimate home build.
5 minutes to Drysdale, 15 minutes to beaches, 30 minutes to Geelong and 90 minutes to Melbourne. Developers may investigate subdivision potential (STCA).
This fertile land parcel has a special feel. Surrounded by successful local producers, country cafes and wineries, it's a great place to establish a convenient rural lifestyle! View ASAP!
