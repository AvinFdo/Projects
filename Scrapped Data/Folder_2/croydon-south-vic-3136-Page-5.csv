Enveloped in northerly light, the family room is the casual hub of the home where the open-plan living arrangement makes it the perfect space for relaxed entertaining. Adjoining the family room is the light and bright kitchen that will impress with its smart design, stainless-steel gas cooktop, oven, dishwasher and large window that overlooks the near-level rear garden.
The family area flows outside to the sun-soaked yard that enjoys a generous expanse of lush lawn, several vegetable patches and large concrete slab ready for a shed or garage. The easy-care garden is a private oasis that affords a carefree lifestyle and plenty of room for children to play and explore.
Zoned at the front of the home, the master comprises built-in robing and access to the main bathroom which is immaculately presented. A separate toilet provides additional convenience to this well-designed layout and services an additional two bedrooms.
Dedicated to meeting the needs of a professional couple, young family, retiree or downsizer, additional highlights include gas heating, split-system air-conditioning, separate laundry, garden shed, carport and off-street parking.
