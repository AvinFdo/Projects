drysdale-vic-3222,1-9 Reservoir Road DRYSDALE VIC 3222,"Motivated Vendor Keen to Negotiate
The property is located on the out skirts of Drysdale adjacent to the farming hinterland. The views across the township of Drysdale to Curlewis, Corio Bay and Geelong are nothing but spectacular. The home is surrounded by established trees and immaculate gardens which create a very calming retreat. For those who love the outdoors a hit of tennis on your own court is a luxury.
The home is inviting and spacious with the main living areas taking advantage of the beautiful views. There are three bedrooms downstairs, a second living area or study and main bathroom. Upstairs you can retreat to the architecturally designed parents area with floor to ceiling windows and private ensuite with spa.
Ample shedding and two horse yards or future orchard complete the package. This property is perfect for a tradesman's storage requirements.
Inspection a must. Reasonable offers considered.

drysdale-vic-3222,17-19 Huntingdon Street DRYSDALE VIC 3222,"STEP BACK IN TIME!
Lets take a journey back in time to the 70's because that is what you will find at this recently listed home in Drysdale.
Drysdale is a country town 20 minutes from the city of Geelong, surf beaches, boat ramps to put the fishing boat in the water, restaurants, wineries, bike trails, sporting groups, shopping and medical centres not to mention the choice of four Primary Schools and three High Schools.
This very solid home comprises formal lounge with open fire place and bar, great for entertaining in the winter months. Formal dining overlooking a private courtyard. Kitchen meals where stepping outside is the potential to enhance the outdoor BBQ area.
Three bedrooms all with BIRs main bedroom with semi ensuite. The original double garage has been converted to a large rumpus room but would lend itself to being used as a home office if required. A stand alone double garage was built with a large workshop at the rear. But wait there's more, a massive shed hidden from the view where the man of the house can be contacted via intercom to be called in for dinner.
Back in the day this home also had a swimming pool that has been filled in but the fencing still remains.
If the 70's are not your thing you can set about changing this home to suit your own personal taste. Do you have a bit of vision? Then book a time with me to show you around.","SOLD - $487,000","3

drysdale-vic-3222,335 Princess Street DRYSDALE VIC 3222,"Rural Haven and Horse Heaven
Established to surpass average equestrian requirements, this 16 ha – 40 acres approx semi-rural lifestyle property centres around a modern four bedroom homestead.
Set in glorious gardens, its solid exterior encloses a cleverly designed passive solar family habitat. Verandahs spanning front and rear allow only winter sunshine to penetrate the welcoming interior, and excellent cross ventilation means no augmented cooling is required.
Double-sided wood heaters set in a brick heat-bank keep two large living areas snug. Adorned with timber corbels and leadlight cabinets, the country-sized kitchen contains all mod cons such as dishwasher and glass-top hob.
Family bathroom with corner spa services three big bedrooms. Generous main has en suite and walk-in robe.
Massive 18×9 metre partitioned shed contains removable stables to allow conversion for conventional use. Attached tack-room and feed storage room, holding pens, hot water washing area, 15 paddocks, cattle yards & town water is connected.
Surprisingly peaceful, it's just up the street from an extensive and comprehensive list of shops, schools and services at Drysdale, around 10 minutes to Ocean Grove and surf beaches, 20 minutes into Geelong and about 90 minutes to Melbourne. Wineries, beaches, Adventure Park, koala sanctuary, cosy cafes, renowned restaurants and much more are also here on the Bellarine. So whether for ponies or peace, this property is simply the ultimate combination of convenience and a tranquil lifestyle.","SOLD - $975,000","4
