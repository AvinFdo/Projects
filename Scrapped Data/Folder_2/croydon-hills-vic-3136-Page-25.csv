The acreage dream is something that many aspire to, yet few are lucky enough to realise in their lifetime. Set on a sprawling allotment of 4001sqm approx., this might well be the property to bring these dreams to life.
The updated home is ideal for family living, with well-zoned spaces that have the ability to adapt and evolve with your needs over time. At one end is a sizeable living/dining space that youll love spending time in, courtesy of an oversized open fireplace, high vaulted ceilings and expanses of floorboards that stretch throughout much of the home. The large master bedroom which boasts a generous walk-in robe and a modern ensuite is adjacent, allowing privacy from the rest of the homes occupants.
At the opposite end of the abode are two further robed bedrooms that are serviced by a central bathroom and a powder room. These adjoin an expansive family room with a wood burning fire which is the perfect place for casual relaxation.
Creating a central meeting place, which is undoubtedly the hub of the home, is a fully renovated kitchen/meals area with deep modern benchtops, quality appliances, an abundance of storage space and a walk-in pantry; adding to this is a long breakfast bench providing the ideal place for casual meals on the run.
This is a home where your favourite place will change with the seasons, and in summer its guaranteed that youll spend as much time as you can relaxing by the inviting inground pool, which is nestled amongst the greenery of lush gardens. Below this is a substantial freestanding pavilion where you can both lounge and dine with family and friends, whilst remaining protected from the elements.
There are a range of extras that complement the home to perfection. They include a study/4th bedroom, gas ducted heating, a garden shed, veggie patches and chook pens plus an oversized double garage with internal entry. This property allows you to live the tranquil country life whilst still being in close proximity to desirable amenities such as local buses, sought after schools including Luther College, Yarra Valley Grammar and The Rudolph Steiner School, a range of shopping precincts and endless amounts of open green spaces.
