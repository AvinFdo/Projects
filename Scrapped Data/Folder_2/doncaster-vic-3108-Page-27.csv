doncaster-vic-3108,1 Howard Court Doncaster VIC 3108,"The perfect court to raise your family.
Tucked away in one of Manningham's best courts hides this split-level three-bedroom home, ideal for a young family or couple with a view of raising the kids in a safe, quiet and highly desirable neighbourhood.
Attracting very little traffic flow, extremely peaceful and only a short stroll from Macedon Square shops and cafes, Manningham Medical Centre, bus transport and St Gregory The Great Primary School, it won't take you long to appreciate why this tightly-held cul de sac is highly sought. You'll also quickly realise the first-class opportunity this uniquely designed home represents; that being the chance to move straight in and live happily ever after or lease it out for a solid return and enjoy the healthy capital gains along the way.
Set beneath towering ceilings, venture downstairs to the lower ground-floor and discover an excellent master bedroom (with fully-tiled ensuite) and sizeable lounge, both of which extend onto a private rear yard with established gardens, while a bright kitchen/dining area enjoys pride of place in the heart of the home and integrates with a paved outdoor entertaining area in a relaxed garden setting.
Two additional bedrooms are serviced by a central fully-tiled family bathroom, while polished timber floorboards, upper-level study nook, gas ducted heating, split-system air-conditioning, double carport, abundant storage, separate laundry and convenient access to Westfield Shoppingtown and the Eastern Freeway makes this opportunity simply irresistible.","SOLD - $928,800","3

The existing dwelling includes 3 spacious bedrooms with built-in robes, a large semi-formal lounge with air-conditioning and a feature wood fire, a dining/family area and a bright kitchen with built-in gas cooking, under bench oven, dishwasher and plenty of storage.
There’s a central main bathroom with enclosed shower, vanity and heat light, a separate laundry with built-in storage, gas ducted heating, split-system air-conditioning and a fantastic outdoor space with multiple seating/entertaining areas and access to the double garage.
