doncaster-vic-3108,39 Fromhold Drive Doncaster VIC 3108,"Solid Family Home on Wonderful, North-facing, Land
Attractively presented with the sleek sophistication of polished hardwood floors throughout, this solid, 3 bedroom + office, brick family residence represents a terrific opportunity to live or let a home with a bright long-term future. Set on a terrific north-facing allotment of 709 square metres (approx.) the prospects for extension or even a complete rebuild (STCA) are undeniable, in this brilliant location that is surrounded by fine schools and is moments from Westfield Doncaster.
With a relaxed flow from its timber kitchen / meals - with stainless steel appliances and plenty of cabinetry - to undercover outdoor living and a spacious, gas-heated living / dining area, the house is already well-proportioned for family life. The possibility, however, to really open-up the rear for a sunny al fresco extension is certainly appealing.
At the rear of the block, a free-standing office with 2 store rooms is ideal for those who work from home or require a home office with its own independent entry, whilst each of the bedrooms are equipped with built-in robes. The central bathroom is large and family-friendly with an independent bath and shower, all separate to the wc. Importantly, a 2nd wc /powder room caters to the living and entertaining zones.
Added bonuses include ducted heating, split system cooling, a double carport, plenty of driveway parking and a rainwater tank to look after the garden.
Whatever you decide, this is a position that will ultimately reward your vision. Such proximity to all the shopping, eateries, cinemas and transport options at Westfield Doncaster will always offer incredible convenience, plus you are zoned for both Doncaster Gardens Primary School and Doncaster Secondary College, moments from Ruffey Lake Park and within easy reach of the Eastern Freeway and the Doncaster Park & Ride.","SOLD - $1,245,000","3

The kitchen features modern stainless steel Asko and Fisher & Paykel appliances, meanwhile the master bedroom is a relaxed retreat with BIRs, ensuite, and doors which open out to the leafy front garden. The other 3 other bedrooms boast great storage options and are all just steps to the stylish central bathroom.
The north-facing outdoor entertaining zone delivers on all fronts and promises a solar heated swimming pool and established gardens, with this outdoor area further having access to huge under house storage! Other property features include a laundry with external access, ducted heating, reverse cycle cooling, plantation shutters, new external blinds, gates at the front which secure the front garden for kids to play, and a double carport.
