croydon-hills-vic-3136,263 Dorset Road Croydon VIC 3136,"A CROYDON CLASSIC - CIRCA 1890 WITH DUAL RENTAL INCOME
A remarkably rare find this classic heritage property combines potential and position on 861m2 approx. allotment and comes with the added bonus of dual rental income from both the main home and rear unit. With potential to perhaps remove part of the unit at the rear (subject to council approval) and possibly develop and build a brand new street frontage home all the while keeping the original homestead to the front means builders/developers and investors could see value here. The property itself is a timeless 1890 profile with ornate rooms in the main home (facing Dorset Road) is joined by a rear one bedroom private unit out the back; both currently earning independent rental incomes. The single-level interior reveals ornate original fittings throughout including decorative high ceilings and a fire place with impressive proportions and scope to restore and allow the character to shine through with some modern trend. Included are two bedrooms with a large third bedroom or second living room at the back, a central kitchen, ensuite and family bathrooms, a rear study or utility room and an elegant front sitting/lounge room. A single carport and large garden shed/workshop are included, whilst the rear unit offers its own garden shed and carport and its own gated, private entrance (off Beryl Street) into the single bedroom with bathroom, small kitchen and living room. A particularly inspiring package for the renovator or investor.","SOLD - $655,000","4
