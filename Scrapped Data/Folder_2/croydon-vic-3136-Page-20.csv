Gracefully positioned within a peaceful no-through road, this classic architecturally designed residence is beautifully presented, emanating all the qualities you would expect from a premium build of its time.
Surveying the street from its elevated position, this comfortable family home welcomes you in with its well-tended landscaped garden, equally enjoyed from the spacious, light-filled lounge and dining where full height windows have been employed to create an arresting visual connection to the garden.

One of the additional bedrooms is appreciably fitted with a twin double built-in robe while the other offers a freestanding robe. The bathroom has been perfectly maintained, conveniently incorporating a twin vanity, shower, bath and separate powder room nearby.
Positioned on an 896m2 (approx.) block, the secure backyard provides ample room for children and pets, while additional benefits list as; highly functional laundry with cupboard and bench space, hydronic heating, split system air-conditioning, linen cupboard, lock-up workshop/storage shed in addition to double carport with dry access. Furthermore, the warmth of timber is used throughout, giving a nod to enduring quality.
