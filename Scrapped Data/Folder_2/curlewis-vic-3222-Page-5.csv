Showcasing a stunning light and bright 'feel' this executive residence is simply in a league of its own! Top shelf in every sense of the word, this property delivers the ultimate lifestyle prospect! The enviable land holding of 722m2 (approx.) is flanked by wonderful parklands which further accentuates the truly tranquil and private setting.
An attractive façade provides a hint to what is sure to be an outstanding inspection; stylish finishes are complemented by unwavering brief to deliver a true 'lifestyle' home
Upon entry you will be instantly impressed by grand proportions and towering exaggerated ceiling heights
A central hub of this residence is a kitchen/family/meals zone which showcases unrivalled size and scale; crisp neutral finishes, expansive windows and an enviable northerly orientation further enhances the wonderfully light and bright experience.
The kitchen serves up an eye catching design; expansive benchtops, custom high gloss cabinetry, feature tiled splash back and stainless steel appliances
4 generous bedrooms; master is complete with a beautifully appointed ensuite and walk in robe - a quadrant of timber windows promote lovely filtered light. All additional bedrooms are equally generous and have built in robes.
A 2nd independent living zone provides further flexibility to what is already an adaptable floor plan
All the modern comforts; ducted gas heating, split system cooling, solar boosted hot water service, ducted vacuum, outdoor shower and quality fixtures throughout ensure all year comfort

It is very difficult to find a property in today's local property market that nails the 'lifestyle' brief better; a double remote garage is oversized and is complemented by the enviable feature of side access (secured by dual timber gates) and a sea of exposed aggregate offers a myriad of off street parking options; room enough for the cars, boat, caravan and even the jet ski
