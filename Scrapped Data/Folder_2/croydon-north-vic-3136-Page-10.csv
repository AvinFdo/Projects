croydon-north-vic-3136,3/307 Maroondah Highway Croydon North VIC 3136,"As new townhouse with brilliant north-facing living space
Near new townhouse offering stylish contemporary class and generous and bright north-facing living, this immaculate 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom townhouse is a relaxed and effortless offering.
This property is positioned at the very rear of a sleek and boutique townhouse development so you’re well away from the service road. Gorgeous Tasmanian Oak floors, luxe stone in the kitchen and bathrooms, quality carpet, and a variety of other modern designer touches are sure to impress buyers which will range from young and growing families to empty nesters.
The undoubted highlight of this property is the expansive central lounge and dining zone, which lets in fantastic natural light thanks to its northerly aspect. The pristine kitchen is included in this main space and is brilliant for the chef of the house thanks to an island bench, stainless steel Blanco appliances including a 900mm cooktop and oven, and a sizeable hidden pantry area which can be an additional space for meals preparation.
The sizeable master bedroom is positioned downstairs and comes with a walk-in robe, ensuite, and access to a private garden. Three bedrooms with BIRs are located upstairs and easily access a charming living retreat and chic bathroom. The north-facing courtyard and garden at the rear is very easy to maintain yet has enough room for outdoor BBQs and entertaining friends and family.
Other property inclusions are a laundry, downstairs powder room, ducted heating, evaporative cooling, ducted vacuum, rainwater tank, video intercom, and a huge double garage. Moments to Luther College, Yarra Valley Grammar, Croydon Hill Primary School, Chirnside Park Shopping Centre, Warrien Reserve, buses, and Croydon Station.","SOLD - $695,000","4

Comfortable and homely, this delightful three bedroom plus two bathroom abode is set back off the street within a well-maintained complex, offers two distinct living zones and presents a highly attractive proposition for the first-home buyer, retiree, empty nester or investor.
Boasting a quality construction across a single-level layout, this lovely brick-veneer residence harmonises with its leafy surrounding and has been thoughtfully designed to afford a relaxed, low-maintenance lifestyle.
Once inside, the interior is bathed in natural light with complements of large windows, furthermore, the adoption of neutral tones help to develop the feeling of light and space. The comfortable L-shaped lounge and dining provides an appreciable environment to spend with family and friends while the timber flooring introduces organic warmth, as well as also providing a highly practical surface for daily activities.
The clever placement of the kitchen has been well planned, with easy access to both the formal dining and meals/family area on either side. Modern in style, the light cabinetry allows the stainless steel appliances to shine, featuring an electric oven and gas stove. Ample storage is an essential component that makes preparing a meal a breeze, while convenient access to the covered back deck is also a huge plus.
Zoned off a hallway away from the living areas, all three bedrooms are well proportioned. The master comprises a walk-in robe, ceiling fan and full ensuite incorporating a shower and large vanity. The central bathroom conveniently features a separate bath, shower and adjoining toilet.
The tiled laundry is fitted with storage and bench space while other inclusions list as; gas ducted heating, double built-in robe (bedroom 2), sizable rear yard, single carport, in addition to a driveway capable of accommodating multiple vehicles.
