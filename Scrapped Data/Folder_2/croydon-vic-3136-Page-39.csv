croydon-vic-3136,47 HUBBLE ROAD Croydon VIC 3136,"Market Buy Sale is now Closed. Property is Under Contract
Offers have come in and the home is now UNDER CONTRACT
We have buyers and we have significant interest, the Section 32's are now available on our Market Buy Online Offer site and the sale is now live for all to have a shot at this wonderful house. If you want to make an offer let us know and we will log you into our secure site to make the buying process simple, easy and transparent.
Only 3 years young and bursting with quality inclusions, this is a home you will be proud to call your own.
We hear all the stories of a tightening market and we know that buyers are being a lot more cautious with their purchases these days, but one fact always holds true. Those really special homes, the ones that make you feel peaceful and relaxed are the ones that attract the attention of buyers.
As they say, the cream always rises to the top.
There are so many ways to describe this home, I mean, it’s immaculate, well laid out, spacious and located in a wonderful new estate surrounded by walking tracks and parklands but the one thing that stands out more than anything else is the sense of peace and serenity that you feel just by walking through the front doors.
You can see the effort and thought that has gone into the presentation from the photos and you can certainly see the size of this family home from the floor plan but what you can’t see online and what you can only experience from an inspection is the feeling of this home. That sense of belonging as you wander from room to room, picturing your furniture here, your desk there and those special family photos hanging on the wall over there.
It’s intangible and difficult to convey in words. You need to experience it for yourself to truly appreciate just how wonderful this home is.
It’s got all the features you would want in a near new family home including stone benchtops, ducted heating, ducted evaporative cooling, internal access from the double garage, luxurious ensuite, separate theatre room and alfresco dining but it’s the love that has gone into creating this home and attention to detail in every aspect of its design and build that you need to experience for yourself.
So, come along to the Open Home and prepare yourself to see one of the best value luxury family homes on the market today.
You will not leave disappointed.","SOLD - $818,500","4

croydon-vic-3136,1/128 Hull Road Croydon VIC 3136,"An Exciting Proposition of Position and Potential.
Ideally located to take in all Mooroolbark has to offer, within walking distance to Paul Street restaurants and services, Manchester Road, Mooroolbark Station and Brice Avenue cafes and shops, this open and spacious block could lend itself to a number of possibilities.
Positioning itself as a solid rental investment, a property that is ready for a modern renovation or for complete re-development into the home you've always dreamed of (STCA), the endless potential here is what will excite most.
Permeating a quality of yesteryear, the current home has a formal front lounge with gas heating and air-conditioning, plus a semi-formal dining area off the kitchen which includes upright electric cooking and plenty of storage and bench space.
Two bedrooms have built-in robes and are central to the main bathroom which includes a separate shower, inset bath and vanity.
Taking in an abundance of natural light, a sunroom at the rear could become the perfect play area, study or home office, connecting cleverly to both a separate laundry and the open backyard.
Offering access right around the property, a vast and enclosed backyard has plenty of scope for development (STCA) and currently incorporates shady trees, garden sheds and a covered front seating/entertaining area.
With easy access to local schools and parklands, Hull Road, the Maroondah Highway, Croydon central, Eastlink and the Eastland shopping and entertainment precinct, this is an exciting proposition awaiting some creative new owners.","SOLD - $440,000","2

Beyond the attractive brick-veneer façade, upon entry, the home leads you into the inviting L-shaped lounge and dining, boasting a charming built-in wood heater and large windows that attract an abundance of natural light into this relaxed living space.
Conveniently positioned between the dining domain and meals/family area, the modern kitchen features a stainless steel electric oven, gas stove, Euromaid dishwasher, soft-close drawers, ample storage and a timeless white finish that creates the perfect contrast to the dark benchtops.
All three bedrooms are well proportioned, robed and zoned off a private hallway, including the master comprising double built-in robes and ceiling fan. Furthermore, the central main bathroom incorporates a separate bath, rain shower and adjoining toilet.
The separate laundry is fitted with a storage space, while other inclusions list as: gas ducted heating, evaporative cooling, blend of carpet and polished floorboards throughout, as well as soft neutral tones. The tradesperson and family will particularly appreciate the huge shed at the rear of the block, in addition to a brick storage unit, double carport and gates to rear for boat, trailer or campervan storage.

Reputable kindergartens and schools are also nearby, including; Hewish Road Child Care Centre, The Good Shepherd Primary School, Ruskin Park and Croydon Primary Schools, Swinburne TAFE and Tintern Grammar.
