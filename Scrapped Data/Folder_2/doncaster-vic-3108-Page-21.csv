doncaster-vic-3108,3/59 Turana Street Doncaster VIC 3108,"Luxurious executive living in Doncaster's heart.
A superior standard of living is the most apt way to describe the living experience you can expect to enjoy inside this high-spec architecturally-designed four-bedroom townhouse, which transcends conventional living with its outstanding build quality, high-end luxury and premier lifestyle location in the heart of Doncaster.
Sleek 2.7m square-set high ceilings, cascaded stone benchtops in the gourmet kitchen and three fully-tiled bathrooms, a bluestone-paved outdoor entertaining area, engineered timber floors downstairs and an exposed aggregate driveway offers a taste of the five-star quality associated with this cutting-edge home thats ideal for the professional couple and young family, while two master bedroom options (one of which is zoned downstairs) will also appeal to downsizing buyers as well as those with multi-generational family living requirements.
A dramatic open-plan living domain captivates with its vast sense of space, light-filed appearance, chic styling and gourmet kitchen, which makes a statement of its own with its 60mm stone benchtops, dark mirrored glass splashback, two-pack finishes, soft-closing drawers and quality Bosch appliances. Its integration with the bluestone-paved outdoor area also creates a seamless indoor-outdoor aspect the grand entertainer will love.
All four bedrooms (master bedrooms with ensuite and walk-in robe) are carpeted to deliver an extra layer of luxury, and speaking of luxury, theres plenty of that inside each of the glamorous bathrooms, which enjoy the luxurious touch of 40mm stone benchtops and a frameless shower. And in the case of the main bathroom upstairs, it boasts a gorgeous freestanding soaker bath that helps calm your mind and relax your body.
A single garage coupled with an extra car space in the driveway provides plenty of space for off-street parking and thats a good thing given the amount of time your car will be parked at home considering city-bound bus services along Doncaster Road, Westfield Shoppingtown, Manningham Library, Doncaster Primary School, Doncaster Secondary College, Schramms Reserve and Ruffey Lake Park are all within walking distance! And just in case you need your car to commute around town, quick and easy access to the Eastern Freeway has got you covered.
Finished with an alarm system, solar hot water and Lennox split-system heating/cooling units, its an upgrade in every aspect of your lifestyle!","SOLD - $1,005,000","4
