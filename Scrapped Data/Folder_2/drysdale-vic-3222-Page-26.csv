drysdale-vic-3222,154 Murradoc Road Drysdale VIC 3222,"25 Acres
This property is just 1.2km from the centre of Drysdale and with a street frontage of 400m to Murradoc Rd. The location is just superb for an acreage property of this size. Consisting of 3 principle paddocks with approx half under a plantation of Sugar Gum Trees. Also included is a small timber cottage, the fact that the property has an existing home means that the successful purchaser can remodel or extend on a site that would allow for the most comfortable size home in the future. The sugar gum plantation will realize a financial return and I suggest anyone considering this property should look up sugar gum plantations on the internet.","SOLD - $650,000","2

drysdale-vic-3222,21-23 Buccleugh Street Drysdale VIC 3222,"Stunning Victorian cottage on approx. 1 acre
This gorgeous property offers a high-end semi-rural lifestyle within a renovated 1850's Victorian cottage on approx. 1 acre. The quaint façade is enhanced by a beautifully formed cottage garden and 'chocolate box' white picket fence. The property boasts sweeping lawns, established and productive fruit trees and a rear paddock for animals or a prized pony. The semi-rural views are serene and private, and unique for an acre property within walking distance of town!
The interiors boast a wonderful 'old meets new' theme finished with professional flare. Lofty ceilings and hardwood floors underpin the charming and luxurious decor. Stained and frosted glass, decretive plasterwork and renovated sash windows hark back to a bygone era.
The light-filled floor plan begins with the traditional double fronted design providing 4 bedrooms with an elegant central hall. Bedrooms are romantic and bright, 1 with a gas log fire in the original fireplace, 1 with extensive robes and most with ceiling fans.
Further in, proper rejuvenation is achieved in the exquisite new bathroom featuring porcelain tiles, Caesarstone-topped vanity, a fully accessible walk-in shower, divine freestanding bath and back-to-wall toilet. A 2nd toilet, in the enormous laundry, is convenient.
The north facing living hub at the rear is breathtaking, capitalising on the beauty of the semi-rural surrounds with extension onto a deep undercover deck that wraps the north and east aspects. The tranquil indoor-outdoor lifestyle offered is second to none. The calibre of entertaining is enviable!
The kitchen is high-end with Caesarstone work surfaces, Ilve 900mm cooker, Siemens dishwasher and huge walk-in pantry. The dining area hugs floor-to-ceiling glazing, bright and inviting in the morning sun. Living is supremely comfortable with north facing picture windows flanking a built-in gas fireplace and flat screen TV. The modern Provincial decor is ideally matched to the location.
A 2nd living zone offers versatility, useful as a private lounge or home office. With deck access and garden views it's another outstanding room.
Climate can be tweaked in each room with the combination of a gas wall furnace, 2 split systems and a further air conditioner. Tailored year round comfort results!
Shedding provides precious space for stock feed or farm equipment, and adjoins a double carport for the family vehicles. Stylish exposed aggregate surfaces surround the home and deck.
13500L of tank water storage ensures well-watered gardens and produce. Along with the array of fruit trees, self-sufficiency can be achieved with the raised vegetable beds and chicken coop.
The privilege of space, convenience to town, luxurious interiors and opportunity to live with a level of self-sufficiency give this delightful home a leading edge. Don't hesitate! This one won't linger!
- Circa 1850 renovated cottage on approx.1 acre with fruit trees, shedding and a rear paddock

In this wine and olive growing area on the Bellarine you will have the cellar to be able to keep your bounty in the dark should you choose to grow grapes or olives on this land. Currently there is a pine planation behind the second home and fenced paddocks for keeping the livestock safe. The current Vendors enjoy the sustainability of having sheep and spinning the wool having established for themselves a viable business adventure coupled with the horses that have enjoyed living in this environment too. Hobby farm with the potential of anything your imagination will allow.
The second residence up on the hill has magnificent views across to the You Yangs and the Bay. This farmhouse has no pretence which is just what you need to feel relaxed after a hard day on the land. Boots off and enjoy the wood heater and the views. Spacious kitchen that also looks out over the paddocks and animals grazing. Two living areas, good sized kitchen and four bedrooms plus study. Verandas surrounding the Cedar clad home, ample shedding.
A rural lifestyle but with a coastal option just down the road in Portarlington. Living here you would have no idea there was anyone else around. The trees and vegetation keep the noise away.
