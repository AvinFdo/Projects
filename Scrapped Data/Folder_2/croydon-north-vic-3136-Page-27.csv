Constructed in the late 1800's, ""Linden"" presents an absolutely enticing opportunity for a sympathetic buyer to take a glorious past and turn it into a brighter future.
Enjoying a generous 1,440.4sqm (approx.) allotment, it is set within a whisper quiet court that lends a rare tranquility. Originally built for Eliza Sharp, innkeeper of the then nearby Prince of Wales Hotel, there is little doubt that in its day ""Linden"" would have been an imposing and majestic principal house.
Awaiting transformation within heritage guidelines, an original facade hides grand proportions and a flexible layout enhanced with many retained period features. Ideal for a large or growing family and enthusiastic entertainers, it may be possible to reconfigure the current layout to suit the needs of your family (STCA).
A short walk to Warrien Reserve, it is perfectly placed for easy access to Croydon North shops, the bus, a choice of shopping options and the train. An idyllic life in a wonderful location will be the ultimate reward for buyers with a vision for the future and a love and respect of the past!","SOLD - $705,000","4
