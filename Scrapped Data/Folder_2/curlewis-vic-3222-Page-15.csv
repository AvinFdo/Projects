curlewis-vic-3222,159 Avila Road Curlewis VIC 3222,"LUXURIOUS LIVING
Driving down Avila Road, Curlewis, is like taking a trip along millionaires' row. It's a chance to see how the other half live, with sprawling mansions, premium water views and tennis courts seemingly in every direction.
Tucked at the far end of the prestigious strip overlooking the bay is this private oasis set on 3.5 hectares.
Hidden completely from the road, the contemporary house is the ultimate lifestyle property with impressive resort-style surrounds and uninterrupted views across the water to the You Yangs. Once inside the secure gates you can enjoy summer barbecues in the pool house or tennis on the floodlit synthetic court.
The house has been designed to maximise the outlook, with all the living areas concentrated on the northern side. And - as this is the kind of place you would definitely want to show off - it naturally provides ample opportunities for entertaining.
The main open-plan kitchen, meals and living area is the ideal gathering space and can easily accommodate a crowd. It offers some of the best views of the bay and achieves an uncluttered, modern look with industrial inspired concrete-like flooring and a neutral colour scheme.
In winter, sunlight streams in through the floor-to-ceiling bifold doors so the heater is rarely needed.
Like everything about the house, the kitchen is generously proportioned and well appointed. It has grey stone benchtops, a 900-millimetre stainless-steel oven and cooktop with canopy rangehood and a mosaic-tiled splashback. There's even a wine rack built in into the cabinetry.
There is a formal dining room (or potential third living room) next door but if casual dining is more your style it's just a short walk across the pool deck to the pool house.
Here you'll find a kitchenette, barbecue rangehood, pizza oven and space for an outdoor setting. Bifold doors run down two sides of the pool house and can be opened to catch the breeze depending on the season.
The swimming pool sits next to the tennis court and has a frameless glass fence.
Back inside, a rumpus room off the main living area provides another option for unwinding. It has carpet underfoot and white plantation shutters on the windows.
There are three bedrooms zoned together off a hallway at this end of the house, two with built-in wardrobes. Between them sits the laundry, toilet, powder room and bathroom, finished with earthy tones with a bath and shower.
The main bedroom is at the front of the house off the entrance hall, well away from the noise of older children. It announces its grand proportions with double doors and delivers a huge amount of space inside. It's a similar story in the en suite, which conceals a toilet and large shower behind either end of a long vanity, and in the walk-in wardrobe.
This bedroom has doors to a private courtyard, one of many outdoor areas around the property. Next door a study with plantation shutters offers a quiet place to work. There is a double garage attached to the house, plus a four-bay garage with a workshop and storage space.
