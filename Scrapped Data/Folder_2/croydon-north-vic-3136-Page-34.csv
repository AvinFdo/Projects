croydon-north-vic-3136,67 Humber Road CROYDON NORTH VIC 3136,"COUNTRY ATMOSPHERE - URBAN CONVENIENCE
Hidden amid an established native garden setting in the green surrounds of Croydon North, sits this surprising and appealing older home with flexible floor plan, on a massive old-school 1586m2 (approx).
Blocks this size are becoming ever more scarce in this small pocket, highly sought after for its mix of bush charm, affordability and urban convenience.
Your first view up the driveway is of the fabulous outdoor covered fernery/ BBQ area. Entry from the feature cedar door to an enormous L shaped living area with feature brick wall. Beyond is a cooks kitchen with a full 3 metres of open bench space! Let your inner Masterchef loose, with quality St George appliances, dishwasher and generous fridge provision completing this super workspace. Adjacent is the informal slate floored dining, which opens direct to the BBQ area, for easy informal entertaining.
The three bedroom all have built-in robes, with the master enjoying a full en-suite. A good sized family bathroom services the other bedrooms. The study (or nursery/4th bedroom), has access to a second outdoor area; an elevated but very private covered front patio with spa. Direct access to the patio is available via the master also, making this area an ideal space for mum and dad to enjoy, with fantastic views by day and the lights of the Ranges by night. This is set over a double lock up garage and spacious workshop with hot and cold water plumbed in and generous under-house storage, (perfect for that wine collection). An extra carport provides easy access to the home and there is even more off street parking for the trade vehicle, guests or the multi-car family. Gas central heating and evaporative cooling take care of the winter and summer extremes.
Enjoy bushwalking in the nearby Flora Reserve while having the the Exeter Road shopping strip, complete with Supermarket, Pharmacy, caf and hairdressing just minutes away, or choose between the Chirnside Park or Ringwood Shopping complexes. Add to the list; easy freeway access, Luther And Oxley Colleges close by, and bus service to Croydon Station 100 metres away. All of this, and the attractions of the Yarra Valley wineries, cafes and galleries close enough for easy, lazy weekend Brunches and shopping.
Endless possibilities present for this property, with the solid bones of the current, very liveable home suited to renovation alone, or add another level (STCA) to create a truly enormous family retreat and capture those mountain views. Strong subdivision potential adds yet another attraction, with room to spare for an additional dwelling. So many opportunities are here for the savvy purchaser. Highly recommended.","SOLD - $585,000","4

The whole family will love this magnificent double storey brick veneer home that is in the heart of the action of the ever popular and sought after Croydon North housing estate.
You are just a heart beat away from the main draw card of the area which is the respected schools such as Yarra Valley Grammar, Luther College, Good Shepard, Croydon Hills and Yarra Road Primary schools.
The manicured gardens set the scene for what's in store as you stroll down the long concrete drive and into the home where you will discover a family friendly floor plan that consists of 4 zoned living areas. The lounge room at the front takes in views over the gardens and will surely be the spot Mum and Dad call their own to catch some quiet time away from the children. The formal dining room will be reserved for special occasions such as Birthday dinners and Christmas or it maybe more appealing to use the area as a home office or study. Walk through the kitchen to the family meals area for everyday dining and then across to the rumpus room that will be the central hub for the families TV watching or you may choose to make it the kids domain and their space in the home.
The recently updated kitchen is simply stunning and comes complete with stainless steel appliances, dishwasher, loads of cupboard space plus gorgeous Caesar stone look bench tops that will make it an absolute pleasure for the chef of the family to create sumptuous meals what ever the occasion.
Lets journey up the stairs to the bedrooms, where you will find 4 good sized bedrooms that all have built in robes and ceiling fans, whilst the main bedroom has a very large walk in robe, full ensuite with double basins, plus a parents retreat that could also be used as an infants bedroom or you may wish to make it into more robe and storage space.
Before we take in the outdoors we mustn't forget other internal features which include gas ducted heating, evaporative cooling, split system air conditioning, ceiling fans, main bathroom with separate toilet, powder room downstairs, plenty of storage cupboards, feature walls plus light filled interiors with bright vibrant colours.
Step out from the family room through the double sliding doors and find the expansive undercover entertaining balcony that will be perfect for family gatherings, parties, casual BBQ's, whilst the water feature sets a tranquil mood for you to enjoy a cool afternoon drink or a leisurely weekend breakfast with a coffee and the paper.
The private backyard has plenty of grassed area along with a built in cubby house to provide hours of fun for the children and pets to play safely under the watchful eye of Mum and Dad.
Car accommodation is well taken care of in the double garage at the front with remote controlled door plus there is room for a caravan or boat along with plenty of room in the drive for extra family cars and visitor parking.

croydon-north-vic-3136,10 Bonnie View Road Croydon North VIC 3136,"ORIGINAL HOME ON HUGE 1235m2
The brick veneer home might be original - just about as it was built in the '60s or '70s. It still has the polished hardwood floors from back then along with a single living area, kitchen/meals area, 4 bedrooms and one bathroom. One concession to modern comfort has been the addition of split system heating and cooling. But the real appeal is the massive 1235m2 block dotted with numerous fruit trees and shrubs as well as a steel double garage. You could renovate the existing home and then subdivide, or even demolish and replace the lot (STCA). It's a fantastic opportunity in a premium location.","SOLD - $605,000","4
