drysdale-vic-3222,34-42 Woodville Street Drysdale VIC 3222,"Contemporary Country Living
Designed and built by the current owners with eco technologies in mind, this stunning contemporary home blends beautifully into its rural environment. Surrounded by the ultimate low maintenance, yet lush, native gardens, the walls of north facing glass rising from the naturally undulating acre of land capture the best of the weather. The deliberate passive solar design fills the home with light and warmth.
From these windows, the 2 living rooms and kitchen/dining area all take advantage of the views across open fields and farmland. Both the master bedroom and fourth bedroom, at opposite ends of the home, open through sliding glass doors onto private decks overlooking the same view. The master also features ample walk-through robes and a modern ensuite while the fourth has a walk-through robe of its own and is situated directly beside the luxuriously designed bathroom. 2 additional bedrooms of generous proportions with oversized built-in robes complete the home.
Outside, the rendered structure of both the home and the first of 2 double garages are finished in neutral tones and a covered portico extends between them, beside which lies the secluded rear garden and vegie patch. The vegetables are fed from a 5,000 litre water tank with pump system that is tucked from view behind the second double colourbond garage, that also has space for a workshop and is fully concreted and powered, further down the property.
Overall, the feel of the home is one of comfort but with decadent touches that make it truly special. A real bonus is that this lovely country home is only a short walk to the Drysdale village shopping centre and restaurants.
