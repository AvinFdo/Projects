doncaster-vic-3108,3 Gilmore Road Doncaster VIC 3108,"Build your dream home or move straight in.
Filled with light, space and opportunity, experience the dream family lifestyle you've always wanted with this life-changing three-bedroom brick residence.
Only a short stroll to Westfield Shoppingtown, city-bound bus services, Doncaster Primary School, Marshall Ave Reserve, the Koonung Creek Trail, Doncaster Library, Manningham Art Gallery and Manningham Civic Centre, the premier location promises a first-class family lifestyle. The decision, therefore, is whether you enjoy that lifestyle inside the charm-filled interior of the existing single-level home or from the brand new luxury sanctuary you could build on the sizeable 724sqm (approx.) allotment (STCA).
Should you choose to retain the existing home, its pristine presentation and light-filled nature caters superbly for your young, growing family. Polished timber floors flow beautifully underfoot, while a master ensuite and spa family bathroom service three spacious bedrooms to deliver a functional approach to daily family life.
Two separate living areas (L-shaped lounge/dining plus a rear rumpus room) means you can truly spread out, while an excellent timber kitchen with stainless steel appliances effortlessly caters to the demands of a growing household.
Having enjoyed upgrades over the years, the home's condition is therefore immaculate, however there's also scope to add your own touches should you wish to truly make this home your own.
Offering modern comfort through ducted heating and evaporate cooling, this lovingly maintained, move-straight-into home also features external roller shutters, secure gated driveway, double garage, beautifully landscaped gardens and a grassed backyard.","SOLD - $1,330,000","3

doncaster-vic-3108,2 Lara Court Doncaster VIC 3108,"A current-day picture of comfort with potential for the future.
If you have the vision, this strong and solid, owner-built four-bedroom home in a private court location provides the perfect canvas on which to turn your vision into a reality.
Boasting the proud record of having just the one owner since built as new and enjoying original yet neat and tidy condition, this excellent home presents a spacious living experience for your growing family. And with a swimming pool in the backyard, you’ll be urging summer to arrive early this year!
But when you do the math and factor in the huge 761sqm (approx.) allotment with the wide 25m (approx.) frontage, the numbers also add up to an exciting development opportunity in a first-class locale (STCA). Virtually easement-free and with no property behind, the rear of the property is therefore one of privacy and beauty given the stunning views it captures — views that your brand new creation could also capture (STCA).
Move in and live happily ever after or knock down and develop (STCA) — you get to decide its fate once the keys to this rewarding property are in your hand. And when they are, you’ll also benefit from the outstanding location that’s within walking distance of the highly regarded Birralee Primary School, Wilsons Rd Reserve and the popular Koonung Creek Trail in addition to being only moments away from Koonung Secondary College, the Eastern Freeway, the Park + Ride and Box Hill’s bustling hub.","SOLD - $1,305,000","4

doncaster-vic-3108,902/632 Doncaster Road Doncaster VIC 3108,"Pinnacle sub-penthouse living with three side-by-side car spaces!
Stand out from the crowd in more ways than one with this unique two-bedroom sub-penthouse that’s distinctly different from the rest inside the Doncaster Primary School and Doncaster Secondary College catchment area.
Presented as new and enjoying the prestige of a 9th floor position with a spectacular 180-degree panoramic view towards the Macedon Ranges, Melbourne airport, the CBD and Port Phillip Bay, it’s a view of perfection from this prized position on top of Doncaster Hill. And when you direct your attention inside this customised two-bedroom abode in the acclaimed Pinnacle apartment complex, you’ll quickly discover that the difference most certainly rests in the detail.
From extra lighting and power points to two-pack cabinets throughout and custom-made furnishings, careful consideration and impeccable attention to detail adorns every square of this upgraded residence. There’s also the generous offering of three basement car spaces, grouped together to offer a sizeable parking bay that’s envy of many!
Watch fireworks light up the night sky on New Year’s Eve from the spectacular entertaining terrace, which is fitted with louvres to offer protection against the elements. Those same views can also be savoured from the comfort of the radiant open-plan living and excellent master bedroom, designed with walk-through robes and ensuite.
Soft-closing drawers, Caesarstone benchtops, quality stainless steel appliances, feature lighting and a plumbed fridge space add style and functionality to the deluxe kitchen, while a private home office (with built-in shelving) at the front of the apartment is particularly beneficial for those running a business from home.
Abundant space and comfort defines the second bedroom that’s serviced by a central main bathroom (with Euro laundry), while video intercom, lift access, secure entry, electric blinds in the living area, an electric heating panel and split-system heating/cooling enhances the appeal of this feature-packed abode.
Add to the mix an unbeatable location where Westfield Shoppingtown and city-bound bus services are just across the road and the Eastern Freeway is around the corner and it’s easy to see why this is the pinnacle of lock-and-leave living in Manningham.","SOLD - $728,000","2
