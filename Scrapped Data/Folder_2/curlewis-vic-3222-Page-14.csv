curlewis-vic-3222,21 Anstead Avenue Curlewis VIC 3222,"Do You Like Different?
So many floorplans these days are very alike. Not this home. Open plan living gives you clear views of the side and rear yard. The direct access from the garage through the laundry just makes bringing those groceries inside so much easier. Over the road from this home is an open area of green space where the kids can ride their bike, scooters, skate boards etc around the paths. Curlewis is a suburb with a new shopping complex including Woolworths a short distance away. Great family home with space for everyone. Main bedroom and ensuite at the front of the home and three bedrooms with family bathroom at the rear. Enjoy a coffee or breakfast in the alfresco area and watch the kids play at the same time.
Don't want the hassle of the build but want a new home well come visit this one.
Bellarine Peninsula has so much to offer for working, living and playing. Restaurants, wineries, cafes, bike trails, sporting clubs, golf, fishing the list goes on and on. Living here gives a real sense of belonging.","SOLD - $375,000","4
