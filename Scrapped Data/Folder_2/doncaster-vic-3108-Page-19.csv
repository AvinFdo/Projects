doncaster-vic-3108,52 Koolkuna Avenue Doncaster VIC 3108,"Brilliant Today with a Bright Future
Immaculately presented and filled with natural light on a generous block of 645 metres (approx.), this timelessly renovated, 4 bedroom, red brick family home is a classic from the mid 20th Century with a bright future. More than comfortable for living today in a family-friendly position near Westfield Shoppingtown.
A generous kitchen / meals is well-deigned to combine excellent storage with a stainless steel oven and range hood, as well as wrap-around benches that provide a breakfast bar, whilst a large lounge room offers additional living space and a downstairs rumpus room caters beautifully to the needs of families.
The master bedroom is a wonderful retreat with a private ensuite, built-in robes and a built-in desk. Meanwhile two of the other bedrooms are also well-appointed for storage with robes.
Not only are all the shops, cafes, restaurants and cinemas of Westfield all comfortably walkable, but you also have several quality schools within easy reach, effortless city access via either the Doncaster Park & Ride or the freeway and Box Hill Central is just around the corner as well.","SOLD - $1,200,000","4
