A soothing modern palette welcomes you into the tiled foyer where you're greeted by a relaxing, light-filled lounge and dining offering a cosy space for socialising and underpinned by a popular L-shaped design. Deep tones from the carpet are perfectly balanced by the timber venetian blinds.
The well-equipped, galley-style kitchen is centrally located between the formal dining and casual family area. Suitably designed to cater for everyday meals through to entertaining guests, the kitchen showcases a spectacular 900mm dual fuel cooker, stainless steel dishwasher, ample storage, breakfast bar and servery to the spacious alfresco.
French doors open up the family area to the alfresco to make up one large space - a boon when entertaining. This spacious outdoor area features a lofty roof with ceiling fan, overlooks the tranquil backyard and offers serene Mt. Dandenong vistas that evoke a sense of calm.
It's the small details that sets this home apart. The master bedroom conveniently comprises a fitted walk-in robe and a superbly refurbished full ensuite featuring a corner shower, stylish vanity with soft-close drawers, toilet and large format tiles. The renovated bathroom has been designed with similar modern decor and features a separate shower, bath, vanity and toilet, as well as being centrally located close to the additional bedrooms.
The tiled laundry is highly serviceable and features cupboards and bench space, while other inclusions list as; gas ducted heating, split system air-conditioning, ceiling fans, built-in robe (second bedroom), storage cupboard, downlights, quality blinds and floor coverings, double garage with rear roller door and additional parking for three vehicles.

This well executed, easy-care home offers a secure, private and comfortable lifestyle for the retiree, downsizer, as well as the first-home buyer or alternatively, the perfect investment to add to your portfolio. Expect to be impressed.","SOLD - $660,000","3

croydon-vic-3136,40A Boyana Crescent Croydon VIC 3136,"Smart, comfortable and utterly sweet.
From the moment you enter the driveway of this irresistibly charming property, you'll immediately sense a serenity that sets you right at ease.
Presenting a highly attractive proposition for the first-home buyer, retiree, empty nester or investor, this lovely rendered-brick home has been designed to afford a highly functional floorplan with comfortable, relaxed living options, as well as a low-maintenance yard.
Framed by an established garden with lofty silver birches adding a tranquil finish, the inviting front porch creates a welcoming vibe and leads you into a fresh and appealing interior where you're greeted by the first of two separate living areas.
Large windows invite lashings of natural light into the carpeted lounge, highlighting a modern grey palette with the result being a cosy space to unwind with friends and family. The separate dining room extends outdoors to the sunny courtyard where you'll enjoy the utmost privacy and tranquil surroundings. The clever floorplan also allows for the third bedroom to be utilised as a sitting room/study or to extend the available living space, with the inclusion of double sliding doors that effortlessly fold back.
The kitchen is simply superb and well equipped with stainless steel electric wall oven, gas hotplate, dishwasher, in addition to surplus cupboards including overhead. Ample prep space comes with complements of dark-toned benchtops that are beautifully juxtaposed with crisp white cabinetry. The kitchen is most definitely the heart of this lovely abode.
The home excels when it comes to the thoughtful layout, placing the sizable master and second bedroom away from the living areas, in addition to this, the master also comprises a convenient walk-in robe and full ensuite. The tiled bathroom incorporates a separate bath, shower and modern vanity, as well as offering an adjoining toilet.
This delightful townhouse is placed at the rear of only one other home, creating the feeling of complete privacy. Furthermore, other inclusions list as; tiled laundry, gas ducted heating, downlights, built-in robes, double linen cupboard, quality window furnishings and remote double garage with rear access.
Situated just a short walk from; Kilsyth Centenary Pool, Chas Allen Reserve with playground, Brentwood Park Kindergarten, Ruskin Park Primary School, tennis courts, as well as being only a brief drive from Croydon Railway Station, The Terrace Shopping Centre, The Good Shepherd Primary School, Yarra Hills Secondary College and BMX tracks.
Croydon is currently undergoing major development growth with significant spending on local infrastructure that is likely to fuel property price and rental demand. One such project is the expansion of Croydon Central, introducing a new market food hall, new essential services, additional parking, upgraded children's play equipment, undercover walkway from Croydon Railway Station in addition to twenty new town terraces.
Excelling in every way, there's a certain charm here that can only be truly appreciated in person. A delay in action will lead to disappointment.","SOLD - $600,000","3
