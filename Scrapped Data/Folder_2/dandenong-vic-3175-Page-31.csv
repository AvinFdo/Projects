dandenong-vic-3175,8 The Glade Dandenong VIC 3175,"Your future is here.
Sale By SET DATE: Tuesday 31st July at 5pm (unless sold prior)
Don’t worry about maintenance, it’s all been done and to the highest standard.
This unique and enchanting home surrounded by quality properties is certainly an eye pleaser and ideal for those who love a flat home with little or no steps. Set on a spacious 529m2 (approx) block close to all the facilities that the City of Dandenong has to offer with its generous parks and walking tracks, shopping centres and schools.
Consisting of 3 large bedrooms plus multiple living areas, this home has everything you’d need and more! The main is particularly substantial with a plethora of robes and lovely ensuite. All bedrooms come with fans.
The living areas, one with a gas coal fireplace and bay windows provide a variety of functions. The near new kitchen has almost new appliances, stone benchtops and is extremely functional, leading to a meals area and a more formal dining space.
Outside is just as appealing. The undercover area off the kitchen provides more opportunity to enjoy the easily maintained and private garden. The double garage will lure all those handymen out there with its spaciousness and drive through access. Having the ability to access the garage undercover is another useful extra in a home that’s already full of wonderful surprises!
With security, including an alarm system, wall furnaces, quality blinds and carpets this is certainly a home of high appeal and one that seldom appears on the market. Situated in a quiet and ideal location, be quick as properties of this standard and quality won’t last.
DISCLAIMER:
The measurements provided of the land and / or property may not be 100% accurate. In order to satisfy yourself of the exact dimensions of the property / land / or of each room, we advise you to conduct your own measurements and / or engage the services of a licensed surveyor.
