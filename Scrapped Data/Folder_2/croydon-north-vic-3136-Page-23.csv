croydon-north-vic-3136,15 Neuparth Road Croydon North VIC 3136,"BIG, BEAUTIFUL AND STATELY
Standing proud and taking advantage of spectacular views on a 984m2 block is this large family home complete with solar heated in ground pool and extensive, easily maintained gardens. Equally impressive is the huge man cave garage and workshop with caravan height roller door on the lower level plus the 6x6.4m double garage for the family cars. Connecting to both is the billiard room and store room, all this along with the main residence on two levels above connected by internal staircase with electric chair lift.
The expansive floorplan is ideal for the large family to enjoy entertaining in style with connecting living, dining and kitchen rooms that take precedence on the entry level, along with one bedroom and study, one of three bathrooms and a large laundry. A further three bedrooms, family bathroom and master bedroom with ensuite and parent’s retreat with exceptional views from the private balcony create a wonderful sanctuary away from the downstairs living spaces.
What better way to encourage outdoor dining and living than under the large pergola which extends the full width of the home. Out the back is a store shed with potential to be studio/bungalow and extensive landscaped gardens with access gate to Hochkins reserve at the rear. Only a short drive or walk to the Croydon North shops and to a variety of schools in Croydon Hills including Yarra Valley Grammar and Luther College, makes it very attractive for a growing family. This is the first time this builders own home has been offered for sale and with some modernizing is an opportunity not to be missed.","SOLD - $902,575","5

croydon-north-vic-3136,8 Susans Court Croydon North VIC 3136,"Court Positioned Home with Future Possibilities
This three bedroom home presents a wonderful opportunity to put down roots in a quiet, treed court location on 860sqm (approx.).
As an investment the value is instantly apparent with Exeter Road and Chirnside Park Shopping, Warrien Reserve and a choice of schools nearby, however, if you're searching for your first home, this is also a valid contender.
A new lease on life would release the value hidden within the walls of the classic brick charmer. Inside you'll find a large open plan kitchen, meals and living area, central bathroom and laundry.
This versatile property also has subdivision potential - build an additional home at the rear or knock down and develop two brand new residences (all subject to council approval).
Additional Features
*Polished floorboards & gas ducted heating
*Built-in robes plus sinks to bedrooms 1 & 2
*Ample off-street car parking available
