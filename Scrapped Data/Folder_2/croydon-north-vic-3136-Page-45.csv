croydon-north-vic-3136,28 Fairview Avenue CROYDON NORTH VIC 3136,"Magical Views With Approved Town Planning Permit
...To build an equally magnificent home. This stunning property features mountainous views of the Dandenongs and valleys, with plans and Town Planning permit to build a substantial home amassing approximately 48 squares. Situated in a peaceful no-thru road, as you enter into an exclusive, gated community, you'll fall in love with the natural environment with serene trees and beautiful homes; you'll feel as though you are 100 miles away from anywhere, but with the convenience of being only minutes from everywhere. Whether you're a builder or simply looking for that perfect parcel of land to establish your dream home, this considerable-sized allotment (approx 2032m2) presents a golden opportunity with all the hard work already completed - or you could alter the plans and add your own ideas (this would be subject to council approval).
When the home is complete, you'll enjoy a meandering driveway up to the dwelling, cleverly designed to lessen the angle of ascent and includes a smart turning point to ensure a straight forward departure. This split-level residence will capture the views from almost every room in the house. Featuring 4 robed bedrooms, the luxurious master comprising a fabulous walk-in robe with full en-suite containing twin basins and double shower. The floorplan also consists of two additional bathrooms, study, four-car accommodation, workshop, multiple living areas including; lounge (sitting), family room, dining, rumpus and billiards. The kitchen is a dream for the entertainer with a large walk-in pantry and island bench where you can sip on a glass of red whilst cooking dinner and enjoy the magnificent outlook - life doesn't get better than this. Your house warming event will see guests enjoying the verandah, balcony and separate patio where the dazzling lights will appear like a sparkling ocean.
If you're not familiar with the area, Croydon is 27km's (approx) east of Melbourne CBD. It has 38 parks covering nearly 17% of the total area, 7 schools, 7 childcare centres and Main Street Croydon is the thriving hub with over 187 traders from restaurants, cafes, cinema and of course the famous Croydon market close by. This means you will reside within close proximity to shops, schools and public transport with everyday living convenience at your fingertips.
Croydon North has become synonymous of being an area of prestige; therefore this magical setting of Fairview Avenue is an address worth noting!
