This immaculately finished high-end apartment, which relishes breath-taking views to Box Hill and right around to the magnificent city skyline, is perfectly positioned for a modern, contemporary and convenient lifestyle.
Enjoying an elevated outlook from a highly secure building with its own basement car park, this immaculately finished dwelling begins with high ceilings and magnificent wooden floorboards.
Two spacious bedrooms at the front of the residence make the most of an unrivalled outlook, including built-in robes and floor-to-ceiling sliding door balcony access, the master also incorporating a sparkling en-suite with marble topped vanity.
The central bathroom continues the marble tones experienced in the en-suite, while an extended hallway opens out to a simply stunning open plan living, kitchen and dining area.
Stone benches and stainless steel appliances adorn a spectacular kitchen which includes a brilliant Island bench and breakfast bar, overlooking a relaxed lounge and dining space.
Incredible panorama windows not only allow an abundance of natural light to flood through this fantastic space but provide un-inhibited views to the beautiful city skyline that is the Melbourne CBD.
From here, friends and family will be falling all over themselves to spend sunny afternoons barbecuing on the spacious outdoor entertaining balcony.
A cleverly designed European laundry, 2 split-system reverse-cycle heating and cooling units, plus additional storage are added bonuses in a flawless package of style and class.
Within walking distance to the Westfield Doncaster shopping and entertainment complex, close to Birralee Primary School and Doncaster Secondary College, plus with great connection to the Eastern Freeway and Eastlink, this really is an easy lifestyle choice.","SOLD - $565,000","2

doncaster-vic-3108,321 George Street Doncaster VIC 3108,"Develop Your Dream On 1,064sqm!
It's one thing to have convenience courtesy of an enviable Doncaster location, but when coupled with a property that's rich in potential, you truly are spoiled. And that's exactly what this property offers: a premium opportunity that astute investors, developers and homebuyers will find it too good to refuse!
A huge allotment measuring a grand 1,064sqm (approx.) lends itself to a host of opportunities. Capitalise on the exceptionally large and very flat parcel of land by building a collection investment units, modern Townhouses or that dream family home (STCA) in a location designed for family living, given its walking distance access to Ruffey Lake Park, Aquarena Leisure Centre, Westfield Shoppingtown and bus services and very close proximity of St Gregory The Great Primary School and the Eastern Freeway.
The perfect location will allow investors to rent out the home while plans and permits are finalised, while the spacious floorplan and desirable features - abundant natural light and timber floorboards, for example - will appeal to homebuyers looking to make their mark with a modern makeover.
Light and bright living areas enjoy plenty of space given their large proportions, while a sizeable kitchen provides plenty of floor and bench space for the aspiring cook. Clever zoning also successfully separates the generous-sized bedrooms (Master with ensuite and walk-in robes) away from the main living areas to ensure occupants are granted an element of privacy.","SOLD - $1,700,000","4
