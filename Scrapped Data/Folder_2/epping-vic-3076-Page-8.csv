epping-vic-3076,47 Plowman Court Epping VIC 3076,"The Perfect Place To Start
Immaculate presentation coupled with a warm and inviting nature paints this bright and beautiful three-bedroom home in a picture-perfect light, making it ideal for the young family eager to kick off their next chapter of lifelong memories.
Colonial-style windows filter plenty of natural light into the sunken contemporary living area on entry, while a generous-sized open-plan kitchen/meals area that extends onto an enormous undercover entertaining area captures the essence of the modern lifestyle. And when you're not playing host to large-scale gatherings out here, enjoy its relaxing nature with a coffee in hand as the kids chase each other around the fantastic grassed backyard complete with a cubby house.
Parents will appreciate the separation between the bright master bedroom (with Bay window framing a leafy aspect, ceiling fan, ensuite and walk-in robe) and private two-bedroom accommodation zone serviced by a fresh family bathroom, while all occupants of the household stand to benefit from the presence of an NBN connection, ducted heating and evaporative cooling.
A double lock-up garage offers secure off-street parking, and with a rear roller door accessing the backyard, you can also keep your trailer or jet-ski securely parked.
Set on a large 626sqm (approx.) block backing onto parkland, this immediately enjoyable home also features window security shutters, separate laundry and alarm.
Completing the appeal is the family-oriented location, which is within short walking distance of Epping Primary School (Greenbrook Campus), Greenbrook Preschool, local Greenbrook shops, local bus services, the scenic Darebin Creek Trail and sprawling parkland and just moments away from Epping Secondary College, St Monica's College, St Peter's Primary School, Westfield Plenty Valley, Epping Plaza Shopping Centre, Epping and South Morang train stations and the Epping medical precinct.","SOLD - $601,000","3
