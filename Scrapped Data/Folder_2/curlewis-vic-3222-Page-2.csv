curlewis-vic-3222,80 Coriyule Road Curlewis VIC 3222,"SERIOUSLY NOTHING TO DO !
State Government now permitting public OFI's for groups of 20 people, social distancing still applies.
We regret that residents from Metropolitan Melbourne or Mitchell Shire must not attend an open for inspection at this stage. Please contact the agent to organise a virtual inspection.
I knew I was going to be impressed with this home when I arrived and saw a double door entry with Australiana stained glass windows.
Usually when you look at an established home there are things that need to be done. Not at this address. There are many features to appeal at 80 Coriyule Road, Curlewis. Firstly, it is not your run of the mill layout that is common with other builders. An out of town builder has offered an alternative open plan that flows well and allows for separate living zones. Careful planning by the vendors has incorporated indoor outdoor areas where the external undercover alfresco boasts full kitchen sink with hot and cold running water. The built in BBQ is connected to natural gas and the home has a 6 star rating and includes solar, water tank and some double glazed windows.
A corner block with rear access has a high carport to protect your caravan, boat or trailer.
An inspection of this home will expose the many other features that make this home suit the relaxed lifestyle we have all become accustomed to.
The Bellarine Peninsula provides the balance and lifestyle to work, live and play. Under normal circumstances we have a plethora of restaurants, cafes and take away outlets. Even in the current environment you can still enjoy getting out for walks along the waters edge or along our very extensive rail trail. Bike riders are also making use of these facilities.
Don't delay this home won't be on the market long just move in and enjoy.","SOLD - $645,000","4
