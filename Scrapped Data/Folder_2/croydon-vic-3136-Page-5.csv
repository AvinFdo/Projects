A unique find in the Luther and Yarra Valley school zone, and steps from Good Shepherd, Croydon hills and Yarra Road primary schools, this four-bedroom home is also around the corner from Lipscombe Park preschool and Reserve, and to McAdam Square shops. An exclusive part of Croydon that many desire to be a part of. Surrounded by lifestyle benefits too, there are many beautiful walking tracks, parklands and lakes to explore in the area, whilst also benefiting from being a short commute to Eastland shopping centre, Eastlink and access and to train stations in Croydon, Ringwood East or Ringwood.
Occupying an almost completely flat, rectangle parcel of land (857m2 approx.), this single level residence has been extended to accommodate a growing family, and now shows off a stunning modernized kitchen with Caesar stone bench tops, an Asko stainless steel dishwasher and a freestanding Smeg stove. With a connection to both living rooms, its also an effortless step out to the large covered deck with café blinds and to the landscaped back yard (with its own putting green I might add).
This beautiful family home provides robed bedrooms, two bathrooms, an open fire place in the front north facing lounge/dining room, evaporative cooling and ducted heating, a mostly repainted interior and striking timber floating floors. In addition, the property offers a double garage, large garden shed, plenty of secured off street parking behind the tall fence and gates, whilst also allowing the chance to consider the prospect of knocking down and rebuilding your own dream home or redeveloping the site with a couple of new builds (STCA).",SOLD - Price Withheld,"4
