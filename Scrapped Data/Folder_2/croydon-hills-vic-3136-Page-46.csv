PRIVATE INSPECTIONS MORE THAN WELCOME
Crowning a tightly-held cul-de-sac, this flawlessly presented Englehart-inspired home delivers an unparalleled level of luxury living, abutting a peaceful reserve and boasting panoramic views from Kinglake across to the Warburton Ranges.
Distinguished and beautifully appointed, this sprawling single-level home makes an immediate statement from the kerb and promises to deliver a highly functional lifestyle, without forgoing aesthetics.
Capturing the essence of fine family living and showcasing sweeping proportions, this superb residence brings together multiple living areas designed for socialising and entertaining. Manicured landscaped gardens surround the home from front to back adding a further measure of tranquillity and escape.
Upon stepping inside, you begin to absorb a sense of the home's spaciousness. Anchored in warmth and homeliness, a soothing mix of neutral and modern tones work perfectly with large glazings to create unimpeded sightlines towards the garden, reserve and distant views, while also drawing an abundant northerly natural light into the interior. A mixture of tiles and new carpet play an integral role in creating an inviting feel, coupled with lofty vaulted ceilings showcasing clerestory windows and central fireplace separating the formal lounge and dining.
The cathedral ceiling in the open-plan family zone results in a feeling of volume and space and is also thoughtfully fitted with built-in cabinetry, in addition to offering convenient access to the rumpus room. The culinary kitchen comprises a stainless steel electric oven and dishwasher, gas stove, generous cupboard and bench space, as well as an adjoining light-filled meals area.
Stepping outside, the deck provides an arresting space to entertain and relax, furthermore, the solar-heated, salt-chlorinated in-ground swimming pool benefits from a water feature and outdoor bar for summer fun. The views from here are equally amazing and the kids will love the neighbouring ponies coming up to the fence.
Opening up through double doors, the sumptuous master is unapologetically comfortable and oriented towards providing the occupants with an experience of complete rest and rejuvenation, featuring two sets of double built-in robes, ceiling fan and huge ensuite boasting a large shower, corner spa and twin vanity. Zoned away from the master off a private hallway, three additional robed bedrooms enjoy easy access to the main bathroom while bedroom five is also robed and separately positioned for family versatility.
The operational linchpin of the home is the super-sized laundry fitted with generous cupboard and bench space. Additional highlights include; gas ducted heating, ducted vacuum, under-house storage, fully automated garden watering system (zoned), two water tanks, remote double garage with internal access and off-street parking.
This property is positioned within close access to a vast array of amenities, such as; Warranwood Reserve, shopping centres, railway stations, Kurboroo Kindergarten, Warranwood Primary School, Melbourne Rudolf Steiner School, Yarra Valley Grammar, Luther College, tennis courts, Jumping Creek, hospitals, cafes and restaurants.
