First time offered to the market, the interior has been updated with a modernised kitchen, whist also presenting a spa family bathroom, three big bedrooms a main living room.
Moving forward, the option to sub divide and renovate the existing home is a possibility, otherwise the option to redevelop the entire site would mean another group of new, low maintenance homes in the street. Surrounding properties lead the example of redevelopment, encouraging a variety of buyers in the area, including first home owners, downsizers and investors. Within a short walk to North Croydon shopping village, the property also provides ducted heating, air conditioning, a detached double garage and garden shed, and 16 solar panels.
