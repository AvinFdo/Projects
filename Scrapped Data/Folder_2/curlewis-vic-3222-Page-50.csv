curlewis-vic-3222,27-29 Sea Haven Drive Clifton Springs VIC 3222,"Neat As A Pin
Nestled amidst the peninsula townships of Clifton Springs & Drysdale this neat as a pin family home is perfection in any ones eyes.
Set on a generous corner block of 623m2 in one of the quietest streets in the area and consisting of four bedrooms, main with full ensuite, you will have all the space in the world for the family or if youre in retirement, have the gran kids stay over and they wont be under your feet. Two living areas create just that bit more comfort.
The kitchen and dining areas are bright and functional with light floor tiles and contrasting dark benchtops, the dining area is complimented with a gorgeous bay window looking out to the north facing rear yard, the main living area is bathed in sunlight via the large windows, and the rear yard has enough space for the kids to play but is simple in presentation and low in maintenance.
The home is warm and inviting, superbly designed, and easily maintained. The double garage is entered from the Eastern end of the property whilst at the Western end there is side access to allow the boat and van to be stored behind secure gates.
Located near primary and secondary schools, central to Bellarines burgeoning wineries and cafés, a stones throw from beaches and fishing spots and shopping just around the corner, you would struggle to get anywhere better.
If you have considered the change to the Bellarine or you are looking to upsize, downsize, resize or just put the feet up, your search for the perfect peninsula home starts and finishes here.","SOLD - $560,000","4
