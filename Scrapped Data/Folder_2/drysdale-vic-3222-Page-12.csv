With over 20 beautifully turned feature posts and accompanying fretwork supporting the expansive verandaâ??s stretching around the home and the meticulously manicured gardens set the mood for your invitation inside.Once you enter the home you will immediately be in awe of the high ceilings, decorative rose featured cornice and matching pendant lights, the open space is inviting and filled with natural light.The flooring is something special, being constructed with Tasmanian Oak and laid in a recessed slab to give the authentic sound of walking on natural floor board yet with concrete underfloor.
The Kitchen area is spacious and practical with two pack finish and overhead cabinetry, meals and living areas adjoin creating a wonderful environment to entertain.

drysdale-vic-3222,11 Princess Street Drysdale VIC 3222,"HISTORIC HOME PREMIUM LOCATION
Let me tell you a little history about this lovely home. Built by a Publican in 1904 who must have wanted to be close to the pub. Later sold to the Education Department and became the Headmasters home for many years. The current owners purchased it from the Education Department about thirty years ago and set about making it their family home. With a Heritage D overlay the front facade cannot be changed or the home knocked down.
So much character with big rooms and high ceilings fitting with the age of the era. Good sized country style kitchen with Falcon oven. Clear view of the backyard. Floors are Queensland spotted gum and there is a new log fire to enjoy sitting by when the weather is cold outside. If you are energy conscious the home is now fitted with LED lights. Visitors or family can be accommodated in a unit that is fitted with a toilet and shower plus a small kitchenette. Or you may like to use this as the fourth Bedroom/Study. Located in a dead end street right in the heart of the Drysdale Township you could not get much closer to the amenities required. Surrounded by historic buildings Drysdale is a historic town established in the late 1840â??s. With a railway line that went from South Geelong to Queenscliff with a stop at Drysdale. Today this station is tourist attraction with steam trains running between Drysdale and Queenscliff on a weekly basis. Check out the link: www.bellarinerailway.com.au/events. I have made Drysdale my town since 1987 and love what it has to offer. Why not come check out my town; you might choose to make it yours.","SOLD - $800,000","3
