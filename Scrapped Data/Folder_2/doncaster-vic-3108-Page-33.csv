• Massive outdoor entertaining Alfresco area

A warm and inviting living area presents a comfortable space to relax and unwind, as does the sensational undercover deck, which looks across the private and spacious yet low in maintenance wraparound courtyard and gardens that integrate with the radiant kitchen/meals area via timber-edged French bi-fold glass doors.
A modern two-way bathroom with a deep bath and floor-to-ceiling tiling effortlessly services the three spacious bedrooms, while a separate laundry and double garage further highlight this fabulous find.
Having the Eastern Freeway/Eastlink within easy reach means daytrips to the Mornington Peninsula are a whole lot easier (and quicker!), while swift access to Macedon Square, Westfield Shoppingtown and high-level elite local private and public schools reinforces the location's desirable status.","SOLD - $815,000","3
