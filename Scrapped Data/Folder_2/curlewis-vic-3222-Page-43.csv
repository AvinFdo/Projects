Do you dream of be able to bring your children up with open spaces to be able to kick the footy, play cricket on Xmas Day, maybe a pony or two, or just be able to run and climb trees? If that's not enough to entice you, how about pack the car with the surfboards and head down the road to one of Victoria's best surf beaches and be on the sand in 10 mins. If you want to get out of suburbia and spread your wings then seriously consider what this lifestyle could do for you.
Imagine waking up surrounded by towering gum trees, collecting fresh eggs for breakfast, feeding the horse and then enjoying a 5 minute walk to the picturesque local Wallington Primary School with the children, or, in a short walk they can catch the bus to one of the local Bellarine Secondary Schools. Situated on almost 3 acres (1.18 hectares) this 4 bedroom residence offers a wonderful opportunity to enjoy a prized rural lifestyle with the added benefit of being just minutes from schools, shops, award winning wineries and the beach. The home sits amongst an established garden that includes beds of roses, a variety of native shrubs including glorious protea bushes and your very own orchard. This generous family home offers warmth and versatility, with open plan kitchen/living/dining, in addition to a more formal separate lounge and dining area. Four generous bedrooms all with BIR will suit growing families, whilst a well positioned central bathroom with separate WC/powder room and an ensuite in the master will certainly appeal. Busy breakfast mornings are made easier in the country style kitchen including a breakfast bar, electric oven and cooktop with plenty of storage. Comfort is assured year round with ducted heating and cooling and an open fireplace for those wintry nights. Outside, you will love entertaining family and friends on the covered alfresco deck, perfect for that weekend BBQ.
