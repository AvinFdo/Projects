doncaster-vic-3108,172 George Street Doncaster VIC 3108,"By George, it has the space you need in the location you crave!
You’ve heard the saying how they don’t build houses like they used to. Now you have the evidence to support it with this strong and solid, quality-built five-bedroom home.
Having been owned and lovingly maintained by only two owners in its lifetime, this secure gated residence has everything you want from a family home: the multiple living areas, zoned accommodation and modern conveniences. And in an added boost, the future occupants can also enjoy the prestige of living inside the coveted Doncaster Gardens Primary School and Doncaster Secondary College catchment area, within walking distance of Ruffey Lake Park, Tom Kelly Athletics Track and bus services and moments to Westfield Shoppingtown, Aquarena Leisure Centre and Jackson Court shops.
Enjoy views towards Ruffey Lake Park from the north-facing formal lounge and adjacent dining room, both of which exude an elegant character and expand onto the front balcony. Size and space, meanwhile, are desirable assets of the vast open-plan living area, which features a large timber kitchen (with quality appliances and pristine presentation) as its centrepiece.
All five bedrooms (master with walk-in robe and ensuite) enjoy the private sanctuary of the zoned accommodation wing, which also houses a large laundry and family bathroom.
A flat grassed backyard punctuated with an assortment of fruit trees is your very own fruit orchard, while disability lift access, ducted vacuum, ducted heating and cooling, video intercom, solar panels and a remote triple garage with access to a large concreted storage room and additional storage area under the house completes this appealing picture.","SOLD - $1,410,000","5

doncaster-vic-3108,65 Winston Drive Doncaster VIC 3108,"Big and spacious with a north-facing entertainer's backyard and a short walk to Westfield Shoppingtown!
Only a short stroll to Westfield Shoppingtown, bus transport, Ruffey Lake Park and St Gregory the Great Primary School, enrich your family's standard of living in more ways than you can imagine inside this light and bright, big and spacious and superbly crafted family home, nestled amongst beautifully landscaped gardens in a premier location within the Doncaster Primary School and Doncaster Secondary College catchment area.
Boasting a breathtaking north-facing backyard, which entertains as well as it calms the mind, on a coveted 742sqm (approx.) allotment with DDO8 zoning, there's also scope to develop up to three modern townhouses (STCA). But just because you can develop (STCA), it doesn't mean you have to, particularly considering the pristine condition of this lovingly maintained residence.
With two separate living zones, your young, growing family will never get in each other's way - only when it's time for dinner! An incredible sense of size and space extends to the spacious bedrooms, all of which are zoned on a private accommodation wing, which also houses a separate study, fully-tiled family bathroom and two-way ensuite that connects with the Master bedroom.
The peaceful and private nature of the elegant L-shaped formal lounge/dining is sure to please, as will the seamless integration between the stunning family living and undercover entertainer's deck, which looks across the north-facing backyard meticulously landscaped with picture-perfect gardens and a paved entertaining area.
A central kitchen is well equipped and proportioned to cater for a growing family, while the presence of ducted heating, split-system heating/cooling, alarm, garden shed, 3,000-litre water tank, generous off-street parking and easy access to the Eastern Freeway adds further appeal.","SOLD - $1,365,000","4
