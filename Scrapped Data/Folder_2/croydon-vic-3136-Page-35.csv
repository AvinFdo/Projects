croydon-vic-3136,43 Sellick Drive Croydon VIC 3136,"Spacious family home with lucrative potential.
Positioned within an established neighbourhood that's popular with locals and families due to a superb array of amenities, this solid brick-veneer home occupies a huge ¼ acre (approx. 1032m2) block and offers lucrative appeal with dual occupancy or multiple unit development potential (subject to council approval).
This spacious four-bedroom home features two separate living areas and harbours its own distinct feel that lays a perfect foundation for modernising in the future. The lounge room comprises a gas heater built in to the fireplace that could potentially be restored, along with floorboards underneath the carpet of the original section of the home.
The well-equipped timber kitchen features an electric wall oven and stove, dishwasher, ample cupboard space, huge pantry and generous bench space. The sizable family room incorporates a dining area and spills outdoors to a fabulous partially covered entertaining deck.
The layout has been thoughtfully conceived, offering four well-proportioned bedrooms, generously robed and well able to comfortably accommodate the family. The tiles in the light-filled bathroom add a measure of practicality, in addition to being fitted with a separate shower and bath.
The updated toilet is conveniently located off the laundry, furthermore, other inclusions list as: gas ducted heating, split system air-conditioning, double garage and abundant off-street parking. The huge backyard offers ample room for recreation and boasts a new boundary fence on the west side.
This address places the occupants just a short stroll from Merrindale Shopping Centre, Dorset Recreation Reserve, Croydon Gums Kindergarten, Dorset Primary School, bus stop, as well as being only a brief drive from Croydon Railway Station, Ruskin Park Primary School, Yarra Hills Secondary College, Tintern Grammar, bicycle tracks, post office, EastLink freeway and tennis courts.
Croydon is currently undergoing major development growth with significant spending on local infrastructure that is likely to fuel property price and rental demand. One such project is the expansion of Croydon Central, introducing a new market food hall, new essential services, additional parking, upgraded children's play equipment, undercover walkway from Croydon Railway Station in addition to twenty new town terraces.
On the market for the first time in decades and located within General Residential Zone - Schedule 1 (GRZ1), not only will this home appeal to the savvy developer, but also the investor, family, tradesperson and keen renovator.","SOLD - $740,000","4
