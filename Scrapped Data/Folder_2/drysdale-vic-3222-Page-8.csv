drysdale-vic-3222,2/46-48 High Street Drysdale VIC 3222,"CONVENIENTLY LOCATED AND CENTRAL TOWNHOUSE
Rarely does a townhouse of this quality become available so close to the centre of Drysdale. It simply demands your attention. Whether you are investing, looking to downsize or entering the property market for the first time - this home needs to be high on your wish list. Two bedroom town houses rarely come any better and it is a credit to the local builder. Completed in 2010, this 14 square Glenvale home on 279m2 is deceptively spacious. Open plan kitchen featuring stainless steel gas cooktop and appliances is the hub of the home with conversations held around the island bench. A tiled dining area also houses a study or craft work space with plenty of storage. Ducted heating and split system cooling/heating modifies the environment for year round comfort. North facing carpeted living areas capture the natural light. High ceilings add to the depth of space and enrich the homely feel. Leading of the carpeted entrance and hallway. Bedroom one has a two way bathroom and super large walk in robe, surely only the most avid fashionista or compulsive shopper could ever dream to fill. The second bedroom has full en-suite and walk in robe. One of 5 townhouses on the site, the gardens are of low maintenance and won't take much of a green thumb to manage. A covered outdoor deck is big enough for patio dining and a BBQ which leads down to a fully fenced courtyard suitable for a small dog. While there is direct access from the garage the car may not get much use as you're only 140m to cafes and public transport, 200m to the medical centre and High street shopping, 300m to the expansive Parklands of McLeods Waterholes Reserve and 400m walk to the supermarket.","SOLD - $470,000","2

drysdale-vic-3222,Lot 19/32 Serene Terrace Drysdale VIC 3222,"Serene Estate
A lifestyle opportunity enabling you to thrive and prosper in an intimate residential estate. Residing in this enviable location offers a lifestyle of coastal living, the convenience of a large regional centre within a 20 minute drive and designed around a semi rural, close knit community with every convenience at your doorstep.
The peninsula location is renowned for the idyllic, outdoor lifestyle. Spend a day at the beach, go fishing or enjoy a glass of your favourite wine at one of our many local wineries. The Port Phillip Ferry sails twice daily from Portarlington to South Bank if you fancy a day trip to the city. You will ask yourself why you didn't make the move sooner.
Ground works to commence late 2018.
