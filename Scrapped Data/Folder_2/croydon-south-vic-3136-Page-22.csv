Tucked in away from street view, this perfect slice of country living is waiting to be discovered. In complete seclusion, you enter through the carport into beautifully landscaped front garden, where this classic styled two storey weatherboard gently nests on 426m2 among the giant canopy trees. Passing over the front verandah into the open plan kitchen / lounge / dining area the natural Baltic pine floor almost glows underfoot, a stunning feature that sets the mood inside to match the natural surrounds; this is a quiet retreat in the midst of bustling Croydon with all of it's public transport, schools, parks and shops. Downstairs also holds the generous master with ensuite and large robes, laundry and access to the charming outdoor area at the rear of the home - a quaint courtyard lined with canopy trees that feels like sitting in a forest. Upstairs holds the roomy main bathroom, 2 more bedrooms with built in robes and an additional bedroom / office. Such a versatile layout and style will be an ideal fit for families, young professionals, empty-nesters, and investors alike - definitely a unique find.","SOLD - $490,000","4
