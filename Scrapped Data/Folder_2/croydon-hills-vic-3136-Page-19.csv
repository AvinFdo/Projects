Enriched with all the right ingredients to ensure a happy household, this family home is number one of the street for a reason.
A seriously generous floorplan that flows from a master bedroom with en suite and a walk in robe, past the formal lounge room, it's the casual retreat of the family/meals zone and the open plan kitchen which has become the most appreciated room of this home.
With a full view to the solar heated pool and outdoor bar, mum and dad can pay attention to the kids when playing outside, whilst catering from a central hub that's complimented by ample storage and bench space, quality cooking appliances and a dishwasher, the kitchen makes every day living and entertaining a breeze.
Joining the master bedroom are another four bedrooms arranged throughout the home, with a spotless bathroom and a lengthy list of inclusions to compliment, including ducted heating, evaporative cooling, home cinema projector and screen with speakers, tinted windows on two sides of the home, a garden shed, water tank and a secured double carport.
Focusing on family values, you couldn't ask for a more desirable location that's within minutes' walk to a selection of schools, including Croydon Hills and Good Shepherd Primary schools, as well as to Luther College and Yarra Valley Grammar.
Bus links, McAdam Square shops and an easy commute to Eastland and Eastlink ensure that parents have just as much conveniences at their disposal, as well as having the reassurance that this is a home that will stand the test of time from the younger years right through to late teens and adulthood.","SOLD - $613,000","5
