croydon-north-vic-3136,65 Warrien Road Croydon North VIC 3136,"The Family Home You've Always Wanted
On a large block of almost a 1/4 acre in size, this wonderful single level Porter Davis designed home will be the family home you've always wanted.
Modern and stylish, the family friendly floor plan offers you 5 good sized bedrooms, the main at the back of the home has a large walk in robe, parents retreat and full ensuite with double basins.
There are 4 living areas to choose from, starting with the real hub of the home which is the spacious open plan lounge room that flows beautifully over to the family/meals/dining area that is adjacent to the kitchen and overlooks the outside gardens and entertaining deck.
The children's retreat behind the kitchen and in between bedrooms 2 and 3 will be the ideal space for the kids to watch their TV shows, play games and most importantly do their homework, all whilst Mum & Dad can keep an eye on them through the open window space to the kitchen.
The home theatre room will bring the whole family together to watch movies, sporting events and other special programs or simply be the space Mum & Dad can enjoy for some quiet time away from the rest of the family.
The magnificent gourmet kitchen is centrally located and well equipped with quality stainless steel appliances, stone bench tops, loads of bench and cupboard space, breakfast bar, plus a Butler's pantry with extra cooktop, to ensure the chef of the family makes their kitchen rule for any meal occasion.
Before we take in the outdoors, we mustn't forget other internal features which include gas ducted heating, evaporative cooling, main bathroom with separate toilet, high ceilings, tiles from the formal entry and through the main living zones, carpeted bedrooms for comfort, shades and blockout blinds on all windows, separate laundry room plus light filled interiors with subtle modern colours and tones.
Moving outside through the concertina doors you will discover the expansive entertaining deck and undercover alfresco area that will be an absolute delight for you to hold family gatherings, parties, casual BBQ's and outside dining, cool afternoon drinks or leisurely weekend breakfasts with a coffee and the paper.
There is plenty of room for the kids to play, with space for basketball, room to ride their bikes on the deck or play chase with the dog around the yard.
Car accommodation is a dream in the triple garage with remote controlled doors, through access to the yard and internal access to the home. There is also an extra car space at the front and room in the drive for another 2 to 3 cars off road.
All this is within walking distance to the popular Warrien reserve with walking tracks, playground and picnic facilities, with a short distance to Croydon Main street for shopping, cafes, restaurants, the newly revamped Croydon Central shopping centre with Coles and Aldi supermarkets, public transport, Luther college, Yarra Valley Grammar and other respected schools plus all other amenities you may need.
The family home you've always wanted is waiting for your inspection, so be quick and make your way through one of the scheduled open homes before auction.
