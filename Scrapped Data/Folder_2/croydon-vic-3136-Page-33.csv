croydon-vic-3136,2/15 Paltarra Court Croydon VIC 3136,"Refined sophistication in quiet court.
This prime court position abutting a serene reserve results in a quiet and relaxed lifestyle for the occupants of this sophisticated townhouse. Backing onto Dorset Golf Course and showcasing carefully curated details designed to deliver maximum comfort and convenience, this ten years young residence offers exceptional low-maintenance living spread across a single-level floorplan.
Located back from the road for privacy and with only two homes on the block (no body corporate), instant contemporary appeal from the warm grey rendered exterior is balanced by the established garden which frames the entrance. Stepping inside, the tones immediately change to convey a soft, opulent feel, complemented by the infusion of recessed ceilings, classic wainscot panelling, Jarrah hardwood flooring and strategically placed lighting.
The connection between indoor and outdoor living is an appreciable benefit when entertaining. The spacious lounge features quality carpet, built-in speakers and adjoins the dining area, with both opening up to the large covered decking which overlooks the Dorset Recreation Trail - a serene outlook that is equally enjoyable from the outdoor spa complete with Bali hut.
The amenities are modern, attractive and practical, beginning with the well-equipped kitchen comprising stainless steel appliances; electric oven, gas stove and Miele dishwasher, in addition to granite benchtops, large corner pantry and generous cupboard space. The bathroom boasts a skylight and shower over spa offering yet another space to relax at the conclusion of a hard day. Other amenities include a powder room and laundry with cupboards and bench space.
Zoned off a quiet hall, all three bedrooms are generously sized and robed, with the master bedroom comprising a fitted walk-in robe, as well as a stylish full ensuite, split system air-conditioning and ceiling fan. The home's additional conveniences list as; gas ducted heating, storage throughout, solar panels (eight), security lights and alarm, water tank (for garden use), shed (x2), remote double garage with internal access and rear roller door opening up to additional parking. The rear yard is extremely low maintenance with extensive paving and synthetic grass, while easy access to the neighbouring reserve extends recreational space if required - great for young kids.
Offering a north-facing orientation, the home is situated only a short walk from Kilsyth Shopping Centre, Ruskin Park Primary School, Swinburne TAFE, as well as being just a brief drive from Croydon Railway Station, St. Peter Julian Eymard Primary School, Yarra Hills Secondary College, Croydon Memorial Pool and EastLink freeway. This location is also a dream come true for the keen golfer with the golf course entrance only meters away.
This stylish, warm and ultra-convenient home will appeal to those who love the very best.","SOLD - $735,000","3
