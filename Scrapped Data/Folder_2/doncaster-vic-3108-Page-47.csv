doncaster-vic-3108,70 Wetherby Road Doncaster VIC 3108,"Potential in a prime location
On the high side of the road, this cherished brick veneer house has been solely family owned and occupied since it was built in 1965. Immaculately presented and filled with natural light, the single-level home comprises 3 bedrooms with built-in robes, a family bathroom and spacious living and dining spaces.
The generous layout is suitable for renovation, perhaps revealing the polished hardwood floorboards that lie beneath the carpets. The bathroom and kitchen have previously been renovated and would benefit from contemporary updating.
Complete with city views from the two front bedrooms, gas heating, air-conditioner, carport and a garage with a workshop/storage area, you could also extend the home, enhancing city views from an upper level (STCA). Occupying a corner allotment of 723 sqm approx., the dual street frontages would suit redevelopment (also STCA).
Enjoying almost immediate access to the Eastern freeway, Koonung Creek trail and buses including the Manningham Loop, this versatile property is also close to East Doncaster and Doncaster secondary colleges, Beverley Hills and St Peter and St Paul's primary schools and Jackson Court shops. Westfield Doncaster and Ruffey Lake Park are also conveniently close by.","SOLD - $1,410,000","3

doncaster-vic-3108,11 Rose Street Doncaster VIC 3108,"A blank canvas with plans and permits for 3 townhouses on 734m2 (approx.)
Superbly positioned in the 'Doncaster Hill' precinct on a pretty tree-lined street, this broad 734m2 allotment presents as a spectacular opportunity, mere metres from Westfield Doncaster, Doncaster Road buses, and popular restaurants.
Manningham's 'Doncaster Hill' strategy was introduced in 2002 to provide housing for an additional 10,000 residents in this district by 2031. The zoning and overlays that govern this area encourage a higher density of housing to promote Manningham's goal, and supported by extensive infrastructure to provide developers the perfect opportunity to implement their creative vision in this exceptionally leafy and expanding location.
While a permit has already been obtained to construct three contemporary 3-bedroom town residences with sundrenched alfresco entertaining areas (plans not endorsed), the plot is a blank canvas. Its peaceful, residential surrounds provide the perfect location for a brand-new luxury home, and its location is impeccably suited to multi-unit construction (subject to council approval).
Its walkable position is just a 10-minute stroll from Westfield Doncaster, and a 5-minute amble to local restaurants, with buses virtually at the doorstep, parklands surrounding including Koonung Creek walking trails, and the Eastern freeway only minutes away for an easy CBD commute.","SOLD - $1,780,000","3
