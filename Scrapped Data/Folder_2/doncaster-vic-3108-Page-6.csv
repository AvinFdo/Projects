More than just a showpiece, however, the home has been designed for functionality with huge amounts of attic storage which is above the double garage and easily accessed from within the main home, as well as volumes of under-stair storage.

doncaster-vic-3108,63 Wilsons Road Doncaster VIC 3108,"Light-filled and elevated Doncaster corner beauty!
PLEASE REGISTER FOR THE REMOTE DIGITAL AUCTION OF THIS PROPERTY BY CONTACTING THE AGENT
Boasting an elevated corner position which further promises wonderful natural light and generous proportions, this well-presented and utterly charming 4 bedroom family residence is nestled in a quiet Doncaster pocket not far from the action!
Freshly painted and ready to live in right now, this bright treasure has a number of terrific highlights. Stylish timber floors dominate much of the home including the expansive central lounge and dining zone which offers a fantastic north-west orientation and incredible light. Just next door is the sizeable family/meals space which includes the kitchen fitted with a quaint breakfast bar and quality appliances.
All bedrooms come with built-in robe storage including the oversized main bedroom which has direct access to the updated dual entry bathroom delivering separate rooms for the shower, bath, and toilet. A north-facing balcony off the family/meals and kitchen area will be bliss on summer evenings where you can enjoy a wine and look out to the views. There is also excellent garden and courtyard space which adds superb outdoor flexibility.
Other property features include a laundry, ducted heating, split system heating and cooling (incl. in 3 bedrooms), and a double garage. While this property is excellent to live in as is, the corner block on 648 sqm (approx.) also opens up the property to redevelopment (STCA).
Moments to Westfield Doncaster Shopping Centre, Birralee Primary School, Koonung Secondary College, Wilsons Road Reserve, Katrina Street Reserve, Elgar Park, Koonung Creek Trail, and Eastern Freeway with Park & Ride option.
