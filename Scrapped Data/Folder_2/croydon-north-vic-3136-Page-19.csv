croydon-north-vic-3136,46 Exeter Road Croydon North VIC 3136,"Style meets functionality.
Embracing a vibrant lifestyle with Croydon North Shopping Plaza only a short stroll away (200m approx.), this home is characterised by its style and functionality introduced by a contemporary reviving of spaces all behind a beautifully rendered and stacked-stone exterior.
A warm and welcoming ambience is realised upon entry into the lounge where a blending of warm greys and off whites allow for the timber floors to take centre stage. Combined with the high ceilings, it creates a greater amount of volume with the overall result providing a roomy and arresting living area. A large bay window invites lashings of natural light and is itself a showpiece of admiration, as are the double-hung windows throughout, retaining some of the original character and charm of the home.
The use of stainless steel appliances brings balance to the kitchen, with updated appliances including electric oven and cooktop, in addition to an as-new dishwasher, together lifting the appeal of the tiled kitchen. The use of natural, honest materials brings warm aesthetic, especially the use of timber where a servery window connects the kitchen to the outdoors. The meals area also uses timber with double doors opening up this space for a clever converging of indoor-meets-outdoor entertaining.
Stepping outside, the expansively paved and covered zone celebrates outdoor living and looks upon a tranquil grassy backyard, enjoying full privacy with complements of screening. The rear yard also houses a huge shed with workshop, separate garage and a carport to the side, all secured behind gates making this a huge plus for the tradesperson. In addition to this, off-street parking is well provided for at the front of the home.
A soothing and relaxed bathroom is achieved with the incorporation of white wall tiles and glass bricks to reflect light around the room, paying homage to simple yet functional contemporary design. A rain shower, deep-soak bath, large mirror, chic tapware and stylish vanity with the added convenience of large drawers are geared around total rejuvenation.
All three bedrooms are large and have built-in robes, furthermore, the home also includes a tiled laundry with huge cupboard, gas ducted heating, evaporative cooling, downlights, broom cupboard, linen press and a sizable front patio.
This highly popular and idyllic environ is much loved for its leafy surrounds and its instant connection to a plethora of amenities, including a bus stop, Croydon North Kindergarten, Griff Hunt Reserve with playground, as well as being in easy reach of Saint Peter Julian Eymard and Manchester Primary Schools, Yarra Hills and Oxley Colleges, railway stations, supermarkets, cinemas, restaurants and café vibe.
Peacefully set back from the road on a generous 836m2 (approx.) block, this property also has potential for development (subject to council approval) located within General Residential Zone 1 (GRZ1). All in all, this opportunity is perfect for the shrewd investor/developer, family or first-home buyer's top pick. We welcome your enquiry.

croydon-north-vic-3136,6 Baringa Road Croydon North VIC 3136,"Flawless family living on 1717 sq m approx.
Offering immense privacy, abundant space and extensive views encompassing the Dandenong Ranges, this light-filled 4 bedroom home occupies a significant allotment of 1717 sq m approx. in a no-through road near Warrien Reserve.
The deceptively large elevated home boasts a single-storey layout with high ceilings, comprising 4 robed bedrooms and a brand new bathroom featuring high quality fittings of frameless rain shower, vanity and bathtub. The formal living room enjoys an open fireplace with inbuilt wood box and floor-to-ceiling windows embracing the landscape, complementing an east facing tiled sunroom and separate carpeted family room. The main and second bedrooms capture morning sunrises, which also sneak into the front foyer through glass panels.
Adjoining a dining room with newly polished floors, the kitchen has been upgraded with a stainless steel Smeg gas/electric cooker and new floor and splashback tiles.
Freshly painted throughout, further highlights include: new gas ducted heating unit with timer, new carpets, curtains and light fixtures, along with all new switchboard, guttering and downpipes.
Seize this perfect opportunity to immerse yourself in a country lifestyle without sacrificing immediate convenience. Landscaping opportunities invite your own interpretation. Grow your own herbs and vegetables, plant a mini-orchard and perhaps transform the wood shed into a ""poultry palace"" for chickens. Tradespeople, mechanics, truck owners and home business operators will also appreciate the reinforced garage on a concrete slab, with its own electrical switchboard, water and telephone line and the opportunity to extend further access to the rear yard should the need arise.
Walk to a bus travelling between Chirnside Park Shopping Centre and Croydon station, nearby schools include Croydon Hills Primary School, Luther College and Yarra Valley Grammar. Shops and amenities are close by at McAdam Square, Croydon North and Croydon.
