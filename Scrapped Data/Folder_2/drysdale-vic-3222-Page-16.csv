drysdale-vic-3222,2 Glengarry Court Drysdale VIC 3222,"Comfortable family living in a quiet court location
In a quiet cul-de-sac of Drysdale, you can enjoy a slice of semi-rural life in this delightfully presented home and fine established garden. An elevated path leads past the double garage to the verandah and front door - with raised garden beds in full bloom. A study/front bedroom leads off the long central hall, and adjacent is the master bedroom with a ceiling fan, walk-in wardrobe and ensuite. On the other side of the hallway a large opening reveals a formal sitting room with glimpses of the back garden. However the substantial terraced garden is fully revealed once you reach the open plan kitchen, dining and lounge room. Sliding doors open onto a covered timber deck where you’re surrounded by a smorgasbord of flora, including roses, daisies, lavender, geraniums and fruit trees - the perfect spot for a long relaxed lunch or dinner. The kitchen has a curved servery bench with a double sink.
An appealing dining alcove has windows on three sides, providing another perspective on the garden. There’s lots of lounge space for kicking back and enjoying a good movie or your favourite TV show. There’s a laundry with storage cupboards, a third and possible fourth bedroom (currently an artist’s studio) and second bathroom with separate WC. At the rear of the property there’s an open-fronted shed which acts as a plant nursery, and also incorporates a fishpond and storage. The house has ducted heating throughout, ceiling fans, and a split system, so year-round comfort is a certainty. The Drysdale shopping centre is just a few minutes drive away - plus schools, sporting facilities and the lake. Land size 711sqm approx","SOLD - $535,000","3

* PHOTO ID REQUIRED UPON INSPECTION

This neat package comprises four bedrooms, the master with walk-in robe and generous full ensuite. The main bathroom and separate toilet are central to the remaining three bedrooms which are equipped with build-in robes. The hub of the home is the open plan kitchen/dining and lounge room drenched in north facing sunlight. The outside area is extremely practical for entertaining, kids and pets with a lovely large deck area, built-in BBQ and pizza oven, garden shed and access into the garage.
Features of the home include; heating and cooling, alarm system, storage in the laundry plus linen press, stainless steel appliances including dishwasher and double lock up garage with remote entry.
This home would be a fantastic addition to the portfolio, first home buyer or the ideal downsize option.","SOLD - $425,000","4

drysdale-vic-3222,41 Stonebridge Road Drysdale VIC 3222,"Top Shelf!
It is very fitting that this fine property is positioned in one of Central Walk's most elevated pockets as it truly is 'top shelf' in every sense!
Showcasing a stunning light and bright 'feel' this quality build will feel like home from the moment you turn the key.
The main living area boasts a lovely northerly orientation and ensures it is bathed in natural light all year round. Big expansive windows frame fully landscaped gardens; feature fire pit area and the beautifully mature gum trees just over your back fence on the neighbouring acreage. An adjoining tiled alfresco offers a lovely area for an early morning coffee or a late wine.
The kitchen 'serves up' a practical user friendly design (complete with expansive walk in pantry) and boasts some luxury features including dual caesar stone bench tops, feature pendant lighting and 900mm gas cooker.
The master bedroom is spacious and is complete with an equally generous walk in robe. The ensuite boasts a luxury oversized shower and his 'n' her vanity.
The second living area continues the theme of 'light and bright' - a feature panelled glass window yet again frames a lovely outlook.
As impressive as this home is to the eye, it also delivers on efficiency with an impressive 5KW solar power system (20 panels).
I personally can't think of another property in today's market which offers such a genuine 'turn the key and start enjoying from day 1'. Simply too many additional features to list but here is just a few to wet your appetite; ducted heating and cooling, dual blinds, exposed aggregate concrete and quality finishes all round.
Central Walk has quickly established itself as Drysdale's exclusive estate. Beautiful wetlands, open tree lined streets and homes stamped with quality as far as the eye can see. This property looks a wonderful home for today and savvy investment for the future.","SOLD - $493,000","4
