drysdale-vic-3222,1/21 Princess Street Drysdale VIC 3222,"A supremely modern Victorian
$360,000 - $400,000
Central to the village and within walking distance to all amenities is this classic, heritage-listed Victorian residence that has been faithfully restored to its former glory with the most modern of improvements. Grand original chimneys tower over its symmetrical roofline and its bull nose verandah and portico, adorned with fretwork, frame the entrance between original casement windows.
The afternoon sun reflects along the length of the glistening floating floors of the arched hallway, off which are three, light- filled bedrooms. All have built in robes and the master, with its original cast iron gas log fireplace, looks out over the garden. A spacious Victorian-style bathroom replicates the era and is splendidly enhanced by an original brick fireplace.
At the end of the hall is the most seamless of extensions, retaining all the hallmarks of Victoriana yet with the most modern of layouts. The open plan living zone is under exposed beams and bordered by period dado paneling which runs the full width of the home.
The modern kitchen, with its bright, white cabinetry, reflects the mix of contemporary with period design. An island bench serves the formal dining room and extensive lounge with its wood log fire, all of which overlook the brick paved courtyard sunken into the lush green lawn of the garden. Adjacent to the kitchen is a large laundry with direct access to a deep double garage which has ample room for a workshop for the home handyman.
All this and more in year-round, climate-controlled comfort. It is a truly delightful restoration that retains the authenticity of yesteryear, yet ensures the astute buyer has the very best of modern comfort and convenience.
A quality restoration.

drysdale-vic-3222,28 Elgin Street Drysdale VIC 3222,"A Privileged Lifestyle
$380,000 - $420,000
The Brunswick wire fencing and brick-bordered cottage garden illustrate the quality and character of this period-style home. You approach the property along a wide and quiet country road and are immediately drawn to the front porch with its bull nosed verandah.
Pine wood floors lead to the master bedroom, complete with walk thru robes and own bathroom, and overlooking the front garden. A home office/study is located on the opposite side of the hallway. Further into the home, the earthen tones used throughout enrich the dining and family rooms adjacent to the vast colonial kitchen. The brick fireplace with its wide hearth enhances the country ambience of the home and central heating provides additional warmth for those chilly winter evenings.
The expansive and dado-walled formal lounge is perfect for entertaining guests, whilst the three remaining bedrooms beyond all have built in robes. There is a central bathroom with spa. Outside, a mature Claret Ash gracefully drapes the alfresco dining area of the large rear deck surrounding the home which is shaded by its bull nosed verandah during the balmy summer months. Looking northward from the porch the large gums in the near distance remind you of the area's farming past, yet you are within walking distance of all the nearby township has to offer.
A cobblestone driveway runs the full length of the home to the garage and serviced workshop at the rear. In addition, there is the lovely garden of lush green lawn and evergreen flora, raised brick vegetable and flower beds and the hens go about their daily chores in the pen at the back of the yard.

drysdale-vic-3222,13 Granville Street Drysdale VIC 3222,"An inspired restoration
Once in a while a visionary makeover hits the mark and this is one to be admired. Centrally positioned amidst a drought tolerant garden with a myriad of pathways, a silver birch is all that remains of its past glory. Rendered in earthen texture and framed by contrasting and modern window furnishings you enter via the enclosed front porch.
The Baltic pine floors reflect the quality of this refurbished 3 bedroom, 1960s abode with an open central lounge and formal dining room taking in the afternoon sun. The quality kitchen, with stainless steel appliances, overlooks the raised timber alfresco dining deck. The front master bedroom has built-in robes, as does the middle bedroom, as well as a bright outlook and ceiling fan. Along the hallway you glimpse the lounge through contemporary cut-out recesses in the dividing wall opposite the central bathroom with its quality fittings.
The large rear yard with its secure fencing is safe and private and provides an ideal environment for children or animals. It sits within a landscape of evergreen flora, screening trees, ground covers and there is a garden shed for the handyman. This is a superb example of a quality renovation.
For the next generation.

$740,000 - $790,000
From its huge and imaginative 1 acre garden through to its exquisite hostess-style kitchen, this is a home tailor made for people who know quality, who love to entertain and who love an expensive lifestyle.
Wherever you look it is obvious the designer, the builder and the owners have pulled their skills, their resources and their imaginations to come up with a first class home that leaves nothing to compromise.
Inside, for example, there is that to-die-for kitchen where its top of the range features will fill your notebook with ticks of approval and in keeping with the modern trends; it is the focal point of the homes 4 spacious bedrooms, the formal lounge and dining rooms and the computer centre. Everything inside is just a few steps from the stunning weather protected courtyard, which is clearly linked to the rear of the huge 4-car garage.
The eye-catchers though are its hosts of features such as the cabana, massage, sauna and entertaining facilities (including a bar and comprehensive powder room with shower). All are perfect for family/guest parties or, alternatively, for those start the day morning coffees or quiet balmy evenings. The 4 bedrooms are of course ideal for extended families, visitors or stopovers while those who might want to add to their guest list should take a closer look at the barn. It is an impressive addition to the garden as it is, but inside you'll see where the owners, as with everything else, have taken that extra step - this time with a second floor to accommodate bedrooms.","SOLD - $705,500","6

drysdale-vic-3222,22 Marsh Court Drysdale VIC 3222,"A Family Home in a Garden Most Splendid
$330,000 - $380,000
Nestled away in a quiet court, sunken below its shaded garden, is this as-new colonial style home. Entering under its arbor and onto the porch, the front door opens into a tiled entry foyer which in turn leads to the large lounge with its light and bright welcoming air. In addition to gas ducted heating, a gas log fire glows bright on those chilly winter nights and evaporative air-conditioning throughout addresses summer extremes. The home also has a 5 star energy rating.
A delightful bay window frames the master bedroom with its large ensuite and walk-in-robe. The additional two bedrooms have built-in-robes with the third also overlooking the pristine garden to the rear, taking in the morning sun. The central meals area, serviced by its large kitchen, also has a vista of the expansive English rose garden and dining beneath the large, shaded pergola would be a must on those balmy summer evenings.
Adjacent to the kitchen is an exceptionally large laundry and a private study/sewing room/fourth bedroom. The large single garage has ample storage and space exists alongside for a carport.
