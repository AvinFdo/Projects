croydon-north-vic-3136,2 Yarra Road Croydon North VIC 3136,"Renovate or Build Your Dream Home (STCA)
Sited on a leafy corner allotment measuring 864sqm (approx.), this home is truly a renovator’s delight. Buyers will relish the opportunity to update the almost untouched floorplan comprising three bedrooms, central bathroom, lounge/dining and separate kitchen and meals.
This is a remarkable opportunity to renovate or build your dream home (subject to council approval) in what is arguably one of the finest schooling locations the east has to offer.
Ideal as accommodation for teenagers, extended family or guests, a self-contained two bedroom bungalow at the rear has its own kitchen and bathroom.
For those seeking a fresh start the block has undeniable appeal as a new home site (STCA). Generously proportioned, it boasts uninterrupted views of the area as well as two driveways – on Yarra Road and Faull Close.
The lucky purchaser will appreciate the property’s position walking distance from Luther College, Yarra Valley Grammar, The Good Shepherd Primary and McAdam Square. Croydon Primary is also nearby as is Croydon Station, Croydon Central and Main Street.","SOLD - $710,000","5
