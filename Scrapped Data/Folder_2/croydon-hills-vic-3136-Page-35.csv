croydon-hills-vic-3136,56 Plymouth Road Croydon VIC 3136,"WALK TO ELITE SCHOOLS, SHOPS AND PARKS
A unique find in the Luther and Yarra Valley school zone, and steps from Good Shepherd, Croydon hills and Yarra Road primary schools, this four-bedroom home is also around the corner from Lipscombe Park preschool and Reserve, and to McAdam Square shops. An exclusive part of Croydon that many desire to be a part of. Surrounded by lifestyle benefits too, there are many beautiful walking tracks, parklands and lakes to explore in the area, whilst also benefiting from being a short commute to Eastland shopping centre, Eastlink and access and to train stations in Croydon, Ringwood East or Ringwood.
Occupying an almost completely flat, rectangle parcel of land (857m2 approx.), this single level residence has been extended to accommodate a growing family, and now shows off a stunning modernized kitchen with Caesar stone bench tops, an Asko stainless steel dishwasher and a freestanding Smeg stove. With a connection to both living rooms, its also an effortless step out to the large covered deck with café blinds and to the landscaped back yard (with its own putting green I might add).
This beautiful family home provides robed bedrooms, two bathrooms, an open fire place in the front north facing lounge/dining room, evaporative cooling and ducted heating, a mostly repainted interior and striking timber floating floors. In addition, the property offers a double garage, large garden shed, plenty of secured off street parking behind the tall fence and gates, whilst also allowing the chance to consider the prospect of knocking down and rebuilding your own dream home or redeveloping the site with a couple of new builds (STCA).",SOLD - Price Withheld,"4

The children's retreat behind the kitchen and in between bedrooms 2 and 3 will be the ideal space for the kids to watch their TV shows, play games and most importantly do their homework, all whilst Mum & Dad can keep an eye on them through the open window space to the kitchen.
The home theatre room will bring the whole family together to watch movies, sporting events and other special programs or simply be the space Mum & Dad can enjoy for some quiet time away from the rest of the family.
The magnificent gourmet kitchen is centrally located and well equipped with quality stainless steel appliances, stone bench tops, loads of bench and cupboard space, breakfast bar, plus a Butler's pantry with extra cooktop, to ensure the chef of the family makes their kitchen rule for any meal occasion.

There is plenty of room for the kids to play, with space for basketball, room to ride their bikes on the deck or play chase with the dog around the yard.
Car accommodation is a dream in the triple garage with remote controlled doors, through access to the yard and internal access to the home. There is also an extra car space at the front and room in the drive for another 2 to 3 cars off road.

croydon-hills-vic-3136,38 Jull Parade Ringwood North VIC 3134,"Family haven with park views.
This lovingly cared for and meticulously maintained home in a much sought after area in Ringwood North is being reluctantly put on the market by its adoring owners. Just a very short walk to North Ringwood shops, a multitude of primary and secondary schools, public transport and backing onto the picturesque Mahon Reserve which is perfect for the family footy or cricket games, this home has it all. Features included 4 double bedrooms all with built in robes, master with full ensuite that has been updated complete with stone benchtops, new heated towel rack and toilet, formal lounge and dining, centrally located kitchen which has also been updated with Bosch appliances, ample cupboard space and pantry cupboard with fitted shelving to maximise space. The family rumpus room is perfectly placed with its cosy gas log fire with this room flowing directly onto fully covered rear patio where you can sit and entertain, cook on the BBQ while watching the kids playing either in the back yard or in Mahon Reserve which is accessed by the gate in the rear fence. For added comfort there is gas ducted heating and ducted evaporative cooling throughout, plus refrigerated cooling, ceiling fans for circulation, double carport, twin storage areas both under the house and the decking with back up from the garden shed. A brick paved path that goes entirely around the home and forming another outdoor entertaining zone at the foot of the patio. The floor plan of this home shows the formal living and dining areas are separated from the family/casual dining and living but linked by the entry hall and kitchen to form an excellent combined entertaining zone which flows onto the elevated covered back deck and lower brick paved BBQ area. Great for parties. The vendors will be sorry to leave their neighbours with friendships that have formed over many years. This is a wonderful opportunity for someone new to bring up their family in this great family home.","SOLD - $978,000","4
