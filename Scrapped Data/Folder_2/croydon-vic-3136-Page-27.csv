croydon-vic-3136,145 Hull Road Croydon VIC 3136,"Two titles up for grabs!
An exciting opportunity exists for the builder/developer, investor or shrewd buyer to acquire this stylishly refurbished home, in addition to a vacant block at the rear which comes with plans and permits to build a soaring and streamline double-storey townhouse only moments from train station and shopping. Offering two titles sold as one!
Tastefully renovated, the front dwelling is tucked behind an attractive fence where an established leafy garden offers tranquil surrounds, complemented by the rendered exterior, French windows and a charming front porch that leads invitingly through to the front door.
A relaxing and welcoming interior instantly impresses with a beautiful combination of polished floorboards, neutral tones and high ceilings featured throughout that result in an open feel. The spacious lounge offers a relaxed feel and adjoins a delightful dining domain that is cleverly positioned, overseen by the galley-style kitchen featuring stainless steel appliances; electric oven, gas stove and dishwasher, gorgeous timber benchtops, glass overhead cupboards and elegant bevelled edge tiled splashback.
Abundantly accommodating the family, four double-sized bedrooms includes a sumptuous master retreat featuring a fabulous step-in wardrobe, built-in vanity with large mirror, renovated full ensuite and sliding door access to a private courtyard devoted to offering total seclusion and complete relaxation.
The bathroom reflects the same modern décor as the ensuite, furthermore, other features include; separate laundry, built-in robes, gas ducted heating, roller shutters, double carport and secure low-maintenance courtyard with spacious outdoor deck adding to the available living options.
The rear property is quietly positioned back from the road and totals 209m2 (approx.). Once complete, with only two homes on the block, this ultra-chic residence will afford the occupants a carefree lifestyle, enjoying the type of enviable comfort and convenience offered by modern urban living.
The plans have been carefully designed to offer all the essential elements of a low-maintenance, contemporary lifestyle, showcasing spacious interiors that includes; two bedrooms, two bathrooms, study nook, seamless open-plan living opening up to a private alfresco and double garage with access to secure courtyard.
This address is located only a short stroll from Chas Allen Reserve with playground, Brentwood Park Kindergarten, St. Peter Julian Eymard Primary School, Yarra Hills Secondary College, bus stop, Kilsyth Centenary Pool, as well as close access to railway stations, The Terrace Shopping Centre, cafes and restaurants.
Croydon is currently undergoing major development growth with significant spending on local infrastructure that is likely to fuel property price and rental demand. One such project is the expansion of Croydon Central, introducing a new market food hall, new essential services, additional parking, upgraded children's play equipment, undercover walkway from Croydon Railway Station in addition to twenty new town terraces.
Not only will you avoid lengthy delays with plans and permits already complete, but there's also the option to rent out or live in the front dwelling until the building is finished - ideal for the builder looking for a smaller project.","SOLD - $700,000","4

croydon-vic-3136,29 Stirling Road Croydon VIC 3136,"Heart of Croydon
Look, I know what Im supposed to do. Im supposed to write this long winded, highly descriptive ad for this property filled with big words and over the top flowery descriptions, right?
Im just not going to, you deserve better and anyway, I reckon youre smart enough to see through all that salesy stuff, so Im just going to cut straight to the chase and give you the facts.
First up, its a big block. It measures a little over 1,378m2.
The zoning is NRZ schedule 2 meaning that the minimum block size is 864m2 per dwelling. Now that means you cant sub-divide this home but for those of you that value your space, it also means that you will never be surrounded by lots and lots of townhouses and units!
There is an old 3 bedroom home on the block. Its tired and needs some love but its liveable, in fact theres a tenant living there now but its no 5 star resort, lets be clear on that. The block is elevated and has a steep driveway which has its positives. The views from the top of the block are spectacular and you get to take in the entire suburb of Croydon, including the full Dandenong Ranges.
The best bit? It sits on one of Croydons most tightly held and sought after areas. It is literally only a few minutes walk to the shops, train and Main Street Croydon and the home is surrounded by beautiful homes that, like this one, are all on big parcels of land.
So yeah, there is a decent amount of work to realise this propertys full potential, but for those who are willing and able to imagine its possibilities, the rewards will be enormous.
Held by the same family for the last 37 years, this is a hard to find chance to grab a slice of premium Croydon real estate. Dont miss out on it, they dont come up often.
Call today for more information.","SOLD - $660,000","3

croydon-vic-3136,573 Maroondah Highway Croydon VIC 3136,"Love, Family and a Home.
This is so much more than a house, this is a loving home filled with childhood antics and crammed with a lifetime of memories and love.
Lets take a step back in time to the late 1950s when Kevin and his lovely wife Joy headed out to a little suburb on the outer fringes on Melbourne called Croydon.
At the time the area was just starting to establish with the post war boom in full swing and the area was still largely orchards, dirt roads and general stores. They came with hopes and dreams of a bright future and a family home filled with the sounds of kids playing and the smells of the Sunday roast with the whole clan after morning church.
They found a block and built their home. Their eldest son was brought home from hospital soon after to their brand new, freshly built house. It was small to start with but so was their family. As they planned from the outset, they built a life and more children were welcomed home. As the family grew so did the house and today it stands as a four bedroom, two living area, two bathroom residence that also has a study or home office.
Over the years they watched their family grow as indeed the suburb of Croydon grew. The family of Mum, Dad and 5 kids went to school, played at the neighbours house and filled this home with the sort of love and memories that live on, long after the family have moved out.
Its time now to hand this off to the next custodians, time to fill this home with some more memories for a new family. This home has history and for the very first time in 62 years, you can own it. You can make it yours and enjoy the space, the access to the shops and the security of being on the service road. It's got a big back yard, a tandem garage, gas ducted heating, evaporative cooling and it has stood the test of time.
Call today and start your own journey and help continue this propertys legacy as a warm, loving family home, that is part of the foundation and history of Croydon.","SOLD - $675,000","4
