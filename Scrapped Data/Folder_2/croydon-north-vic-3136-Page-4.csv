This modern, attractive and comfortable home places you where every convenience is at your disposal; only a brief walk from Croydon North Shopping Plaza and bus stop, in addition to offering a carefree, low-maintenance lifestyle.
Evoking a sense of undeniable style and appeal, this seven-year-old, double-storey residence is privately positioned back from the road and presents a relaxed sophistication brought together by a beautiful collection of calming spaces.

Tastefully conceived, the stunning kitchen is equipped with stainless steel appliances; electric oven, gas stove, dishwasher and rangehood, sleek two-tone cabinetry, wine rack and generous bench and storage space. The living zone opens up to an enviable covered deck through double-stacker doors, resulting in a sensational merging of both areas, as well as boasting ambient warmth from the wood heater.
