SOLD BY JAMES BROUGHAM. PH: 0412 620 498.
Enviably positioned in a desirable pocket of Croydon South within brief walking distance from Merrindale Shopping Centre, this sturdy three-bedroom home has been well maintained and affords one lucky buyer a low-maintenance lifestyle.
This property is ideal for the first-home seeker, investor, family or retiree who prefers a home that can either be enjoyed as is, or can be effortlessly altered to suit the buyer's own personal preferences. Designed over a single-level layout, the floorplan offers comfortable indoor and outdoor living, in addition to appreciable modern conveniences.
Beyond the charming picket fence and brick-veneer exterior, a wide and welcoming entry hall leads through to the L-shaped carpeted lounge comprising decorative cornices and a series of large windows that produce a light-filled space.
The employment of timber throughout brings an organic feel, especially in the kitchen where the cabinetry and flooring create a beautiful finish. Features include; gas cooking, dishwasher, generous storage and tiled splashback. The separate laundry boasts additional storage and is conveniently located off the kitchen for everyday functionality.
Three sizable bedrooms begin with the master enhanced with a double built-in robe and large windows, in addition to two further bedrooms (one robed). The updated bathroom incorporates a separate shower, modern vanity, as well as a separate bath and adjoining toilet.
Neutral tones throughout generate a continuity from room to room while other highlights list as; gas heating, air-conditioning (lounge and master), linen cupboard, LED lights, large shed/workshop and a lengthy covered outdoor entertaining area at the rear of the home. A tree-lined drive leads around to a single carport at the rear.
This home is situated only a brief distance from Croydon Railway Station, Woodland Park with barbeque area and playground, Croydon Gums Kindergarten, Tinternvale Primary School, Tintern Grammar, Croydon Memorial Pool and EastLink freeway with direct access to surrounding suburbs and Melbourne City Centre.
