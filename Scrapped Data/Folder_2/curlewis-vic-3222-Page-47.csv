curlewis-vic-3222,9 Glen Fair Way Leopold VIC 3224,"A Rare Beauty, One of a Kind
An exceptional example of award-winning Porter Davis design; this home being 1 of only 3 ""DRYSDALE LOFT"" design with the added loft and being the ONLY one of its calibre with this façade, truly a rare find!
A seamless fusion of character with a contemporary edge, light filled, airy and open with an astute footprint that certainly has family practicality front of mind.
What sets this home apart from many others is certainly the free-flowing floor plan which includes 5 bedrooms, study, 3 living areas plus a purpose-built multimedia theatre room. Complimenting this family pleaser is a fantastic grand alfresco plus a decent grassed yard for the children to play. Located moments from ALL major amenities, public transport including main pick up/drop off points for schools; situated in a cul-de-sac style location opposite a beautiful reserve with a cut through to the nearest park. You are buying into the best of what Leopold has to offer not to mention being a short distance in both directions to Geelong City and the best of what the Bellarine has to offer.
The unique façade is different to what you would normally expect in an estate and rather deceiving from the front, with charming street appeal and an established garden you will feel compelled to know what is beyond the special stained-glass doors. Upon entry you are greeted with spotted gum floating floors that run throughout the home with a welcoming wide entry and high ceilings, the recesses and bulk heads that appear throughout the home continuously implement a point of difference. The fore of the home hosts a very generous 4.1 x 4.4 master suite with oversized walk-in robe and a lavish full ensuite including floor to ceiling tiles, double stone vanity, seamlessly tiled walk-in shower with shower niche, lots of storage and separate toilet. Internal access into the garage; a study and 5th bedroom with BIR's complete the first part of this home. The highlight is the open plan kitchen, meals and dining with access onto the expansive Spotted Gum decked alfresco area. The loft ceiling complimented with an array of windows gives this area a sense calm, light filled and airy year-round. The designer kitchen will excite any avid chef with stone benchtops, in trend tiled splash back, huge walk-in pantry, 900mm gas oven/cooktop, in bench power points and connections to plumb your fridge in, dishwasher complete with custom over bench pendants.
Room to home a large dining table without encroaching onto the living room makes entertaining a breeze, the boutique sliding panels that open onto the alfresco blends inside to out perfectly.
The children's wing is zoned with a separate rumpus area, also with sliding access onto the alfresco, main bathroom carrying through the same lavish finishes as the ensuite including deep freestanding bath tub, separate toilet, 3 bedrooms all equipped with BIR's and large laundry room with built-in tough, large linen press and access to the yard. The stairs are neatly tucked away and out of sight and will lead you to a very impressive games hall which hosts the most amazing sunsets AND, for the movie buffs, you can't go past the well-thought-out purpose-built cinema room.
