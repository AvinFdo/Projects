croydon-hills-vic-3136,33 Rosemary Avenue Croydon Hills VIC 3136,"Unique family entertainer near sought-after schools
A first glance can be misleading. This home's well-presented façade completely contradicts the magnificent residence revealed beyond the front door. Thoughtfully designed to embrace passive solar principles, all 3 living areas face north.
Featuring clerestory windows, the generously-robed master bedroom is at the front, adjoining a spa ensuite with a large shower and twin basins. The tri-level floorplan is especially geared towards families with teenagers, providing them with an entire level to sleep, study and relax, including a top floor rumpus and balcony with breathtaking views.
Flowing outside to extensive alfresco decking that's covered by a pitched roof pergola, a formal living room is accompanied by a spacious family room with garden and deck access, bordering the kitchen. Featuring a walk-in pantry, the open plan kitchen is equipped with top-quality European stainless steel appliances including a Bosch dishwasher and a Neff gas cooktop (2 wok burners) and steam and pyrolytic ovens.
Solely owner-occupied for its 14 years, this unique, light-filled abode also features a compact study/generous storeroom, plus a powder room, complementing the luxury inclusions of: gas ducted heating, 2 ducted evaporative cooling units and 2 Daiken reverse cycle split systems, Rinnai instant temperature-controlled gas HWS, a security alarm, abundant storage, a garden shed and an oversized double garage with an auto door, internal and rear access.
Positioned to enhance its status, this brilliant home is just moments from Luther College and Good Shepherd Primary School, Yarra Valley Grammar, Croydon Hills Primary School, McAdam Square, buses and Yarrunga Reserve.
