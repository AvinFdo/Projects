croydon-vic-3136,2/12 Alfrick Road Croydon VIC 3136,"Designer apartment in Croydon Central.
Capturing a relaxed yet sophisticated look, luxury living with urban connectivity in the heart of Croydon has never looked so attractive and promises to immediately impress the first-home buyer, retiree, investor or those looking to downsize in style.
Located on the ground level with immediate street access, comfort, security and visual appeal have all been factored into this low-maintenance property, ensuring an easy and ultra-convenient lifestyle is enjoyed.
Contemporary appeal is achieved through a well composed blend of rich charcoal and crisp white tones. The intuitive choice of modern materials and textures are continued within the apartment where neutral tones offer a relaxing vibe.
The open-plan layout features high ceilings, adding a sense of volume to the living zone while the adoption of Tassie Oak floating floor produces a highly practical and striking finish. The living room cleverly spills outdoors to a spacious entertaining area to expand the space and offers a fabulous zone to share with friends and family.
Supreme finishes incorporated into the sleek kitchen consist of Caesarstone benchtops and stainless steel quality appliances; electric oven and gas hotplates. Timber-look cabinetry offers adequate storage and eye-catching aesthetic that harmonises well with the tiled backsplash.
The master comprises two double built-in robes and ensuite-effect bathroom boasting a semi-frameless shower, stylish vanity, toilet and large format tiles that create a glamourous finish. The apartment also brings together the very best elements of today's lifestyle, with inclusions listing as: Euro laundry, split system air-conditioning, storage unit, secure parking and its own separate access from the street for those who relish their privacy and autonomy.
This address is suitably placed within close reach of ample services such as; Arndale Civic Shopping Centre, Croydon Railway Station, Aquahub, Croydon Park with playground and barbeque area, bus stop, cafes, cinema, as well as the EastLink freeway only a short drive away. Reputable kindergartens and schools are also nearby, including; Hewish Road Child Care Centre, The Good Shepherd Lutheran Primary School, Ruskin Park and Croydon Primary Schools, Swinburne Tafe and Tintern Grammar.
Croydon is currently undergoing major development growth with significant spending on local infrastructure that is likely to fuel property price and rental demand. One such project is the expansion of Croydon Central, introducing a new market food hall, new essential services, additional parking, upgraded children's play equipment, undercover walkway from Croydon Railway Station in addition to twenty new town terraces.
Unashamedly bold, modern and boasting all the essential ingredients of a life without compromise, this well-crafted home offers an appealing future.","SOLD - $325,000","1
