doncaster-vic-3108,414/7-11 Berkeley Street Doncaster VIC 3108,"The pinnacle of lock-and-leave living.
Sale By Set Date Tuesday 19 March at 6.00pm
If you've placed a premium on location, then here's a home that registers a 100 per cent match with the added luxury of stylish, low-maintenance living that's ideal for first-time buyers, investors, downsizers and busy professionals.
Living on the footsteps of Doncasters most fashionable resident, Westfield Shoppingtown, means you can treat yourself to some retail therapy, indulge in a gourmet dining experience or watch a movie and totally disconnect from reality any time you need a little me time. Factor in walking distance access to city-bound bus services, schools, Manningham Art Gallery and parks and its evidently an instant lifestyle upgrade.
Offering a five-star standard of living outside, its also much of the same inside this glamorous apartment, which enjoys the prestige of high-quality finishes and a luxurious fourth-floor position within the trendy Berkeley apartment complex.
A desirable north-facing orientation allows the sun-kissed open-plan living domain to be showered in an abundance of northern light, while the large entertainers balcony also capitalises on its north-facing aspect by framing a glorious outlook towards the Kinglake Ranges.
Square-set high ceilings, warm timber floors and a modern kitchen with stone benchtops, stainless steel appliances and sleek cabinetry enhance the apartments strong contemporary appeal, while two generous-sized robed bedrooms (master with ensuite), a chic main bathroom, double-glazed windows, split-system heating/cooling, Euro laundry, secure basement car space (with storage cage) and secure access are further highlights of this lifestyle winner thats also handy to the Eastern Freeway.","SOLD - $522,800","2
