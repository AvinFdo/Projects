A desirable north-facing orientation allows the sun-kissed open-plan living domain to be showered in an abundance of northern light, while the large entertainers balcony also capitalises on its north-facing aspect by framing a glorious outlook towards the Kinglake Ranges.
Square-set high ceilings, warm timber floors and a modern kitchen with stone benchtops, stainless steel appliances and sleek cabinetry enhance the apartments strong contemporary appeal, while two generous-sized robed bedrooms (master with ensuite), a chic main bathroom, double-glazed windows, split-system heating/cooling, Euro laundry, secure basement car space (with storage cage) and secure access are further highlights of this lifestyle winner thats also handy to the Eastern Freeway.","SOLD - $522,800","2
