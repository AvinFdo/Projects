Enjoying a north-easterly orientation in a service lane, this opportunity lies within walking distance of McAdam Square, Lipscombe Park, a kindergarten, medical centre and Luther College/Good Shepherd Primary School.
Solely owner-occupied, the 862sqm approx. land parcel was purchased from Mr. Max Brown in 1964 and the master-built house was complete in 1966. The solid, brick veneer residence boasts a single-level floorplan comprising 3 bedrooms with built-in wardrobes, serviced by an original 3-part bathroom with powder, shower and bath rooms. A light-filled dining room accompanies a spacious lounge room, while the kitchen adjoins a meals area.
With ample scope for renovation and extension, the home also features a gas heater, reverse cycle split system, ceiling fans and a single garage. The deep backyard has been cleared in order to reveal its potential for development, whether that be by adding a rear dwelling or pursuing complete site redevelopment (STCA).

In a coveted area of Croydon along a winding country-style lane, this family home is poised on a beautiful acre block (4046sqm approx.) that’s privy to views of Mount Dandenong. Tightly-held by one owner since 1968, opportunities like this are seldom offered.
Light-filled and spacious, there’s room to spread out here with an open-plan living and dining area connected to the kitchen and a long balcony where you can take in the majestic views. Kept comfortable with heating and cooling, the interior also boasts three bedrooms and a central bathroom.
Rounding out the list of features is plenty of off-street parking - including a double carport - and outstanding under-house storage. Spanning the entire dwelling, it could potentially be converted into additional living space if required (STCA).
Offering a level of peace and privacy you would expect from a more rural location, this rare find is close to all amenities such as Croydon Station and Main Street, Melba College and Sacred Heart Primary School.","SOLD - $910,000","3
