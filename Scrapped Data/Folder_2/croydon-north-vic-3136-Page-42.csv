PROPERTY SOLD
This wonderful family home is not a fairy tale, it's a true wonderland and the perfect home you've always been dreaming of.
On a block of over a 1/4 acre in size in the ever popular Croydon North area the home offers you 4 good sized robed bedrooms, the main with walk in robe and full ensuite.
Zoned living areas provide space for the family to spread out and enjoy with Mum & Dad making the front lounge room their space, whilst the rest of the family will love the large open plan family dining at the back.
The modern gourmet kitchen is well equipped with quality stainless steel appliances, dishwasher plus plenty of bench and cupboard space to ensure the chef of the family is a master chef for any meal occasion.
Before we take in what the outdoors has to offer, we mustn't forget other internal features such as gas ducted heating, evaporative cooling, main bathroom with toilet, powder room, polished timber floors, new carpets, feature walls plus light filled interiors, freshly painted with modern colours and tones.
Stepping outside from the family room you can forget about a mad hatters tea party as the undercover entertaining balcony is simply amazing and is much more suitable to enjoy family gatherings, special occasions, parties, casual BBQ's, a cool afternoon drink, a winter warming hot chocolate in front of the open fire or a leisurely weekend breakfast with a coffee and the paper.
The backyard is MASSIVE with manicured lawns to make it a matter of what game to play first, backyard cricket in summer, the AFL grand final in spring or transform it into a white water world with plenty of room for a pool and even then enough space for a full sized tennis court.
Car accommodation is well taken care of with the double carport at the front, visitor parking in the concrete drive, plus side access to the yard behind double gates for the safe off road storage of caravan, boat or trailers.
No need to keep dreaming this wonderland will be a complete reality with your inspection today.","SOLD - $630,000","4
