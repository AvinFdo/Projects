Packaged with loads of natural light, towering cathedral ceilings, a triple garage and excellent presentation, it's also a home that you could move straight into without having to lift a finger.

doncaster-vic-3108,7 Meadowbank Avenue Doncaster VIC 3108,"More like a house 45sqm living
Multiple living areas and bedrooms of generous proportions are at the heart of this grand and luxurious 45sq (approx.) executive family residence. And with a premier location close to shops, schools, parks and transport, its the perfect lifestyle package for a host of buyers.
The fluid, three-level layout enhanced with superior finishes and a fully-tiled ensuite and walk-in robe to every bedroom embodies all that is great about luxurious low-maintenance living, and in doing so, delivers an executive residence that clearly belongs to a higher class of living.
Introducing a relaxed contemporary lounge on entry with access to a private study, the long and impressive hallway glides beyond the deluxe guest bedroom before arriving at the sun-kissed north-facing open-plan living domain thats spectacular in every sense. Wall-to-wall stacker doors filter loads of northern sunshine into the sleek living space, while a first-class kitchen with a huge island breakfast bar, stone surfaces, intelligent storage options, quality Smeg stainless steel appliances and a Butlers pantry is an entertainers dream.
If the indoor entertaining options are not enough, a private north-facing yard with a sunny deck and in-ground swimming pool (both sheltered with retractable awnings) completes the picture, integrating seamlessly with the fashionable interior to create a dream indoor-outdoor lifestyle configuration.
A central retreat upstairs acts as a successful buffer between the glamorous master bedroom (with city views from its private balcony) and two generous-sized bedrooms, while a large basement level comfortably accommodates an excellent home gym room, cellar, large laundry, workshop and remote double garage.
Dressed with established landscaped gardens, this high-impact low-maintenance home also flaunts stunning square-set high ceilings, polished timber floorboards throughout the two ground-floor living areas, ducted heating/cooling, on-trend lighting, no common land and its own stylish street frontage.

doncaster-vic-3108,2/73 Tram Road Doncaster VIC 3108,"Spacious Statement in Style, Metres from Westfield
Merely metres from all the attractions of Westfield Doncaster, this impeccably stylish and surprisingly large, 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom townhouse is a rare statement in fine style and sophistication. Refreshingly presented with towering ceilings, a gleaming white colour scheme and polished hardwood floors, this is a contemporary home, timelessly attractive and easily maintained in a dream Doncaster location.
As it spills outdoors from an open-plan kitchen / meals / living to a paved undercover BBQ area, the home is clearly suited to al fresco entertaining. Huge windows introduce streams of natural light, whilst the kitchen is beautifully appointed to gourmet standard, with attractive and durable stone waterfall-edged bench tops, to complement its superior stainless steel appliances and volumes of glossy cabinetry.
Importantly, the bedrooms are well-removed from each other, offering a level of privacy that is rare for a townhouse. Upstairs, the master bedroom offers parents the joy of an ensuite and walk-in robes, whilst a retreat offers families an all-important second living zone. The remaining bedrooms are each appointed with built-in robes; the downstairs bedroom is conveniently adjacent to another of the bathrooms, ensuring the needs of families are comfortably met.
Additional highlights include a double lock-up garage that delivers the convenience of direct internal access to the main home, a well as split system heating and cooling.
Walk to an endless selection of shops, cafes, eateries and cinemas at Westfield from this Doncaster Secondary School-zoned position near Doncaster Primary School, plus you are just moments from buses to the city or Box Hill Central, plus you have the Eastern Freeway and the Park & Ride nearby as well.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"3
