This superb three bedroom residence is positioned in a picturesque, park-like complex and emanates an exciting urban vibe with a variety of amenities at your doorstep.
Boasting a single-level floorplan, comfort, security and visual appeal have all been factored into this low-maintenance property, ensuring an easy and ultra-convenient lifestyle is enjoyed. The brick-veneer exterior is framed by manicured lawns along with a lush green garden showcasing a weeping Silver Birch tree paired up with Bird of Paradise plants to welcome you in.
Homely appeal is achieved through a well composed blend of warm modern tones, eye-catching light fittings and quality floor coverings, especially enjoyable in the inviting lounge which boasts an adjoining dining domain. Large windows not only encourage natural light to fill the interior but also provide a serene view to the garden.
The modern kitchen has been carefully conceived to ensure a pleasurable cooking experience is enjoyed. Glossy white cabinetry has been employed to provide ample storage, in addition to an Ilve electric oven and gas stove, plus a dishwasher for added convenience.
The meals area showcases an attractive bay window and cleverly spills outdoors to a spacious entertaining area to expand the living options, furthermore, a gazebo located at the side of the home offers yet another beautiful outdoor space to relish. It really does feel as though you have been whisked away to a private paradise.
Designed for an added measure of comfort, the master is enhanced with twin double built-in robes and luxuriously renovated ensuite-effect bathroom incorporating a frameless rain shower, separate bath, Caesarstone vanity, soft-close drawers and glamourous large format floor-to-wall tiles.
