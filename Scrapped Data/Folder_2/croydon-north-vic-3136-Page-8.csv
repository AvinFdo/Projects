croydon-north-vic-3136,4 Piedmont Court Croydon North VIC 3136,"Great Home, Superb Locale
Move in, unpack and relax; its that simple. This fully renovated family home enjoys an elevated corner position in a quiet no through road, close to a number of desirable amenities.
The attractively rendered residence offers light filled spaces that incorporate four bedrooms and two modern bathrooms; the privately located master offers a deluxe ensuite with a deep freestanding bath, making it the perfect place to relax and unwind at the end of a long day.
There is also a choice of living areas. The first is a spacious living room to the right of the entrance; the second a combined dining/family space that adjoins a hostess kitchen. With gloss cabinetry, Caesarstone benchtops, glass splashbacks and quality Bosch stainless steel appliances, the space is the perfect fusion of practicality and contemporary appeal.
The outside areas have been as perfectly crafted as those indoors. Fully landscaped gardens and lush grass are visible from almost every angle in the home, creating wonderful green vistas throughout. There are also a choice of places to enjoy these whilst entertaining or dining alfresco style. One is amongst the garden, overlooking the generous yard, the other is an undercover verandah which enjoys views across the neighbouring treetops.
Additional features which further enhance the appeal include gas ducted heating, evaporative cooling, split system heating/air-conditioning, a well-placed European laundry, striking Tasmanian Oak floorboards, a full irrigation system with pop up sprinklers, a water tank and a double remote carport behind a secure roller door.
The area is highly sought after by families who are seeking a choice of quality schools; youre spoilt to have Luther College, Yarra Valley Grammar, The Rudolph Steiner School, Good Shepherd and Croydon Hills Primary in close proximity. Youre also in easy reach of a number of open green spaces, local buses with rail links and popular shopping precincts including the recently renovated Eastland.
This opportunity is too good not to explore, so make it a priority and inspect without delay.","SOLD - $792,500","4
