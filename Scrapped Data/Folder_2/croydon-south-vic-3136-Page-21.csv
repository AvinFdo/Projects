croydon-south-vic-3136,52 Andrew Crescent CROYDON SOUTH VIC 3136,"Oh So Groovy, Baby!
Flaunting a seventies splendour, this “groovy” residence enjoys an elevated position in a tightly held pocket of the Tintern Estate, and, from its lofty heights, uninterrupted views across the hills are impressively viewed.
Architecturally designed, created and adorned in 1972, this bold residence has been well maintained over the years, while the decor has been left untouched, culminating in a magnificent stage-like showpiece.
Upon entry into the lounge, and creating a contrasting backdrop to the fluffy shag flooring, an impressive mural has been painted onto the main wall creating an eye-catching focal point. An impressive floating staircase spirals up to a traditional “rec room' complete with panelled walling, box seating with storage and bold patterned accents, the customary wet bar and a powder room.
Leading off the lounge is the formal dining area with brick feature wall, an air-conditioned study or fourth robed bedroom and the classic kitchen, resplendent with a corner booth, new cooktop and updated oven plus dishwasher.
Three robed bedrooms are exuberant in their furnishing; the main bedroom showcasing an 'Austin Powers' inspired decor, a charming kids room with ceiling art and a third with a vibrant colour scheme, sharing the retro bathroom with a separate shower and bath, funky wall papering and gold-sparkly flooring, of course.
Outside offers plenty of room for the kids or pets to play in the secure rear yard, while landscaped front gardens add further appeal to the imposing streetscape.
Further benefits include split-system heating and air-conditioning, laundry with external access, fresh paint throughout and a remote double garage with workshop.
Located close to Tintern Grammar and Tinternvale Primary School, Cheong Park and playgrounds, Ringwood East Community shops and station, Maroondah Hospital, Eastland Shopping Centre and EastLink, the 848sqm (approx.) allotment would also provide the perfect setting to build your dream home (STCA) with an Independent Building Report available . Offering plentiful options, this memorable home will impress, enquire now!
