drysdale-vic-3222,24 Eastwood Crescent DRYSDALE VIC 3222,"Pristine and stylish living in the hub of Drysdale
Built just four years ago, this pristine family home stands out from the pack with a modern colour scheme, stylish kitchen and sparkling bathrooms. Wide windows throughout and raised ceilings give a feeling of spaciousness. A double roller blind system, incorporating sheer and block out options, allows privacy without compromising on natural light. Tiling has been used to tie together the kitchen, meals, halls and wet areas, with neutral carpeting to the living area and bedrooms. Modern ceiling fans and down lights have been used throughout.
The location speaks for itself, with the home set on a quiet street, walking distance from Drysdale's charming town centre, schools and sporting centres, just a hop from the beach and golf course at Clifton Springs, and only a short drive to Geelong!
Set well back from the street and with a wide frontage, this near-new solid brick home has a wide veranda to protect the entry. From the private formal entry, complete with security door, the home opens into an open plan kitchen and meals, with adjacent living area. The entertainers' kitchen features fresh white cabinetry compliments the warm bench tops and tiled splashback, hitting the right mark for style. Completing the perfect set up are matching Bosch gas cooktop, fan-forced electric oven and dishwasher, a double fridge cavity, generous pantry with powered appliance shelf, and the ever-essential wide island bench with breakfast bar for quick family meals. A multitude of wide drawers are a thoughtful addition, ensuring that this stylish kitchen is a pleasure to use and nothing ever gets lost at the back of a cupboard! The wide meals area with RC-AC, opens through double sliding doors to the covered outdoor entertaining area, for easy indoor-outdoor living year round. The adjoining carpeted living room enjoys views of the front garden, with twin highlight windows set each side of an energy efficient, freestanding climate controlled Coonara heater. This heater keeps the home toasty through the cooler months while providing a charming centrepiece for the room.
All bedrooms are east facing, keeping them cool and comfortable throughout the summer months and all offer ceiling fans. The well-proportioned master bedroom is zoned off the living area and features a spacious walk-through dressing room with in-build robes, leading into the roomy and bright en suite. Fresh white cabinetry and tiles, with neutral bench tops run with the modern theme used in the kitchen. The spotless en suite offers a wide vanity with recessed sink, toilet and semi-frameless shower with feature tiling. Bedrooms two and three are zoned off the meals area, creating a dedicated children's wing, both with plenty of room for study and play, and both with double built in robes. Close by is the sparkling family bathroom with the same fresh colour scheme used in en suite and kitchen, bringing stylish continuity to the home. The spacious family bathroom has a bath, semi-frameless shower and wide vanity with recessed basin. The separate toilet is situated beside the family bathroom.

drysdale-vic-3222,14 Eastwood Crescent DRYSDALE VIC 3222,"SHOW HOME QUALITY IN CENTRE OF TOWN
This beautifully presented abode of show home quality sits amongst beautifully manicured gardens, both edible and ornamental, creating a fantastic outlook from indoors and a great backdrop to the spectacular alfresco area; the ultimate bayside lifestyle!! The large plot of 724sqm is perfectly suited to those with additional recreational vehicles to store and is set in the heart of Drysdale only a short walk to schools, shops and entertainment venues. This home truly offers a tranquil and relaxed life.
The brick and tiled home has been designed with flair. Soaring raked ceilings within the living space bring the leafy green outlook right into the home. Vast and zoned, open plan spaces are separated by a gourmet quality galley kitchen with stainless steel appliances with glass mosaic features tiles across the splashback. North facing and filled with natural light thanks to a bank of highlight windows, a casual sitting area links with both the dining and kitchen spaces which spill out onto the extensive alfresco deck through large sliding glass doors. Protected by stylish shade sails for those hot summer months, this outdoor space performs as a third living area, protected on three sides from the elements creating a calm and tranquil spot to enjoy the lush gardens.
A second living, (again linking to the kitchen and outdoors), is where the family will gather for those snug and more intimate occasions.
4 bedrooms are zoned perfectly for family living with a master suite located at the front of the home with a large walk in robe, and an ensuite beautifully tiled with a chocolate and mushroom scheme. 2 further minor bedrooms feature sliding door robes (1 with TV & phone point suitable as study) while the third offers its own walk in robe, perfect for young children and all of their toys. A central family bathroom offers a fully recessed shower and luxurious sized bath with a wide surrounding hob, which sits beneath a large window, perfect for lining with candles on nights where you want that sumptuous hotel feel.
Outdoors will also not disappoint. Along with the remote double garage with direct internal access, the huge plot with 18m street frontage allows double gates leading to the rear yard to allow for extra vehicle storage. A graveled parking bay behind stylish timber gates easily allows for both caravan and boat storage for those lucky enough to own all the toys! Down the back of the plot, behind a healthy stretch of Santa Ana lawns and a beautiful display of evergreen hedging and statement Silver Birches, a well established mini orchard and fenced veggie patch will keep the gardener busy. An array of apple, apricot, pear, nectarine, plums and lemon will keep the pantry full throughout the year.
