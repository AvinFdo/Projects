croydon-south-vic-3136,32 ANDREW CRESCENT CROYDON SOUTH VIC 3136,"Love the Location, Relish the Serenity
There's no denying the grand nature of this stately home, perched majestically on its elevated allotment in the coveted Tintern precinct to present a compelling case for buyers searching for family living of large proportions.
Warm neutral tones combine abundant natural light to create a positive and inviting ambience from the very outset, adding a visual element that reinforces the home's aesthetic appeal and freedom it gives to the future occupant to move in and decorate as they please.
Space and height are achieved in superb style with soaring Cathedral ceilings and expansive living areas that offer a fantastic mix of formal and informal options.
A radiant lounge on entry is warmed by a Jetmaster open fireplace and capitalises on its elevated nature by capturing the scenic outlook on offer, while cooks of any level will appreciate the stylish kitchen defined by its abundant bench space, quality stainless steel appliances and easy-to-clean glass splashback.
Glass sliding doors promote the integration between the light-filled family living and sheltered outdoor area, decorated with blossoming wisteria to offer a wonderful escape from the daily grind, as well as a superb entertaining space during the warmer months. The kids of the household will also appreciate running around the large backyard, home to mature gardens and a manicured lawn.
Successful zoning sees the generous-sized bedrooms located on a separate section of the home, each fitted with built-in robes and serviced by an updated family bathroom (floor-to-ceiling tiling, modern vanity and corner spa bath). A large Master bedroom also spoils parents with its updated ensuite.
Offering modern comfort, the home also enjoys evaporative cooling, gas ducted heating and ducted vacuum.
Enjoy morning strolls through any of the nearby parks, and as a future resident, you'll appreciate the walking distance access to Tintern Schools and very close proximity to Ringwood East train station, Eastland Shopping Centre and Eastlink.","SOLD - $593,000","3

croydon-south-vic-3136,9A Helen Avenue CROYDON SOUTH VIC 3136,"THE ART OF MODERN LIVING
Only two years young, this beautifully designed and built home will tap into your every emotion.
Not only is it refreshingly young with all the mod cons you could desire, it has a sense of family focus, with a strategic balance of style, sophistication, tranquility and simplicity.
Whether or not the red painted door is deliberate to encourage luck and prosperity, one thing is for sure, the new owners of this home will be very, very happy here. Either way it's a lovely welcoming into this split level home, with high ceilings and stunning Black-Butt timber floors taking immediate focus.
The splash of red is again displayed in the kitchen, which also has a movable island bench, quality stainless steel appliances, Caesar stone bench tops and a very well sorted pantry. Being able to stay within close range of guests in the dining and living area, or to be near children playing outside in the garden or on the Merbau deck, the thoughtful consideration of the design is obvious.
The use of Caesar stone flows into the powder room, laundry and up into the family bathroom upstairs, where you'll also find another two bedrooms with plenty of built in robes space, as well as a teen/children's retreat, keeping adults to their domain downstairs, complete with their own en suite and walk in robe.
Features include ducted heating, reverse cycle cooling, ducted vacuum, 5000 litre water tank and a paneled double garage with internal access.

croydon-south-vic-3136,2 Greenridge Lane CROYDON SOUTH VIC 3136,"DON'T YOU JUST LOVE TO BE SURPRISED!?
A pleasant surprise waits at the end of this semi-private lane. Almost taking full ownership of the street, this extensive property provides more than what you probably bargained for.
Who'd think that a home in this estate would offer so much usable land around it, providing exceptional parking, entertaining and play space for the whole family. Sitting on approximately 1011m2 (approx.), this is a place where one could find solitude everyday without having to go away from the home to find entertainment, and when inside, it provides the perfect interior to raise your family.
Step into an open plan living, dining and kitchen area, all of which take pride in the views into the front and rear gardens, as well as a close connection to the large outdoor entertaining pergola and spa. There are three bedrooms with robes and two bathrooms to compliment.
A gas wood fire sets the scene in the cooler months, with the addition of ducted heating and split system cooling to make sure the Melbourne weather is kept at bay throughout the seasons.
Highlights: Secured car accommodation for two cars, a large workshop, garden/storage shed and a water tank.","SOLD - $510,000","3

A quiet cul de sac location in the popular Gateway Estate is where you'll discover this flowing single-level four-bedroom home that's tailor-made for the growing family or those looking to enter the market in style!
Two radiant living areas exude contemporary appeal as a result of their open, spacious nature and warm contemporary colour scheme. A curved bay window bathes the large lounge in natural light, while an island bench accentuates the functionality of the well-appointed kitchen that overlooks the family living featuring indoor-outdoor options.
A large backyard is a play haven for kids; sheltered alfresco with gas mains BBQ plus an entertaining barn is the ultimate man cave, delivering your very own pub experience with its timber paling walls and bar!
Bedrooms are of a generous nature, and for parents, a large Master bedroom comes complete with walk-in robe and modern ensuite. The combination of gas ducted heating with split-system heating and cooling also ensures you're kept cool in summer and warm and snug in winter. Adding to the appeal, parkland, schools, shops and Eastlink are only minutes away.","SOLD - $481,000","4
