IMPORTANT INFORMATION - *COVID-19 Response Strategy*
We recognise people still need to buy, and we want to help make this possible by providing a safe environment for everyone.

Please contact Michael McKenney on 0421 211 319 to arrange a private inspection.
One Valma Street presents to the market a spacious and conveniently laid out home, with family living at the forefront of its design.
Occupying a sensational and opportune location atop a sprawling 714m2 (approx.) block, this unique, updated home delivers a fantastic opportunity for anyone wanting a spacious, elegant, family friendly home, in an elusive pocket of Bayswater.
The well-proportioned layout provides plenty of space for the entire family, boasting a formal entry, large formal lounge/dining area, a separate well-appointed gourmet kitchen featuring stainless steel Blanco appliances, a family/meals area and an enormous rumpus room. As well as five bedrooms including a master with full ensuite and walk-through robe, a fully renovated bathroom that is conveniently located between the secondary bedrooms and an abundance of storage throughout.
Adding to what is an already impressive abode is the home cinema/soundproof studio, that can be found at the rear of the double garage, something that not many homes possess! Continuing the family friendly theme, there is plenty of front and back yard area, for those fun-filled days with family and friends.
Bonuses include new ducted heating, three split system air conditioners, plantation shutters, abundance of storage, private and peaceful court setting, and so much more, all designed with comfort in mind.
