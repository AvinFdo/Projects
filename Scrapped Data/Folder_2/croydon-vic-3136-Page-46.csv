croydon-vic-3136,6 Monteith Street Croydon VIC 3136,"A DEVELOPERS DREAM IN THE ‘TOORAK’ POCKET OF CROYDON
They don’t come much better than this for buyers looking for future redevelopment prospects.
Set on a substantial 1157m2 block in the highly sought after and adored Monastery area, this immaculate and original three-bedroom abode has stood the test of time and is now screaming for some enthusiastic buyers to give her new sparkle, build your new dream home or for property redevelopers to consider the almost completely flat site to make way for up to three new townhouses (STCA).
Along with being extremely comfortable with the potential to live in or rent out, the floorplan also provides a main living room with gas heating, a spotless bathroom and a separate kitchen and meals area. Outside, the double carport and sufficient off street parking is appealing, and the addition of a garden shed and a bungalow/studio which is privately placed at the very rear of the block adds more appeal.
The well-established, and what is considered the affluent pocket of the area, this lovely property also prides on being close to the Croydon train station and Main street shops, with McAdam Square shops across Maroondah Hwy and quality schools, including Luther College, Yarra Valley Grammar and Good Shepherd Primary School.","SOLD - $999,950","3

croydon-vic-3136,14 Wickham Road Croydon VIC 3136,"Attention Developers - Corner Site !!!!
This absolutely level site has 2 road frontages, allowing the lucky developer the potential to have all ""own street frontage units/townhouses"" with NO Owners Corporation (STCA). This means maximum sale value for all of the sites. Furthermore, due to the East - West layout of the land, north facing rear yard will be easily achieved opposite the Cameron Road boundary of the property, providing ease of design.
The current home is ideal to provide rental income whilst applying for development approval, or could easily be renovated, as the first townhouse, with it's neat presentation, good size 3 bedrooms, ducted heating and split system AC, various sheds and outbuildings, large carport and quiet location.
If you are a builder/developer that is tired of analysing difficult sites and achieving less than ideal sale values due to having Owners Corporation, poor open space areas and consequently compromised designs, then this is for you. They don't come much more straight forward than this!

croydon-vic-3136,14 Wickham Road Croydon VIC 3136,"Attention Developers - Corner Site !!!!
This absolutely level site has 2 road frontages, allowing the lucky developer the potential to have all ""own street frontage units/townhouses"" with NO Owners Corporation (STCA). This means maximum sale value for all of the sites. Furthermore, due to the East - West layout of the land, north facing rear yard will be easily achieved opposite the Cameron Road boundary of the property, providing ease of design.
The current home is ideal to provide rental income whilst applying for development approval, or could easily be renovated, as the first townhouse, with it's neat presentation, good size 3 bedrooms, ducted heating and split system AC, various sheds and outbuildings, large carport and quiet location.
If you are a builder/developer that is tired of analysing difficult sites and achieving less than ideal sale values due to having Owners Corporation, poor open space areas and consequently compromised designs, then this is for you. They don't come much more straight forward than this!
