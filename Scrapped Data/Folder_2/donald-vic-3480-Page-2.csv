This home is the iconic country cottage - a real credit to the current owner who has gone over and beyond in presenting this property. It even has the white picket fence. Nicely positioned near the local swimming pool and a short walk to the main street.
The 2 bedroom cottage has been re-painted inside and out, has 4 x split system a/c's plus a gas log fire in the lounge, wooden bench tops in the kitchen with a farmhouse dbl sink, Smeg electric stove next to the original wood stove (not in use) and even a barn style sliding door. The dining area is on original floorboards and is adjacent to the kitchen.
The lounge has polished boards, ceiling fan, a/c and the gas log fire. So much to see in this beautifully presented interior.
Outside the real feature is the rear view over the Richardson River treeline & wetlands, the block slopes away giving this view from height. The owner has installed a retaining wall to give the yard a split level effect. Steps and landscaping all feature.
Fencing is all very good, the carport and outdoor area have exterior blind protection and the garden shed has a cement floor.
Well worth your consideration. Call Rob on 0467 044484 to arrange an inspection.","SOLD - $164,000","2
