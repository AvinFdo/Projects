croydon-hills-vic-3136,70 Settlers Hill Crescent Croydon Hills VIC 3136,"Cosy in the Crescent
This lovingly maintained brick home is a wonder of comfort and quiet. Tucked right in the heart of picturesque Croydon Hills, this home offers a peaceful setting, framed by gently winding roads and flowering hydrangea plants.
The home offers a sizeable open-plan living and dining area, which is given a warmth by the richly coloured floorboards. The large windows that border the house, fill this area with light and allow it to flow onto a beautifully appointed deck and entertaining space through a large glass sliding door.
The spacious main bedroom offers convenience with his-and-her built-in robes, additional cupboard space and an ensuite effect bathroom which also serves the remaining 2 bedrooms. Each of these is also equipped with roller shutters, keeping the rooms insulated and comfortable.
A freshly landscaped garden and newly painted driveway accentuate the home’s aesthetic. At the top of the driveway sits a remote double garage with mezzanine-style storage.
A short drive to Eastland Shopping Centre, and moments from primary and high schools and several clusters of local shops, the location offers convenience while preserving peace and quiet.
