croydon-vic-3136,7/60-62 Beaufort Road Croydon VIC 3136,"Superb Single Level in Lifestyle Location
Placed amid manicured grounds amongst a small collection of single level residences enjoying a close proximity to desirable amenities and bordering East Ringwood, this neat unit provides an excellent entry level property for first homeseekers, an easily manageable downsizer or secure investment prospect for the quick acting buyer.
Comprising a 2 bedroom brick veneer unit ready to move in to and enjoyed. A wide entrance separating the lounge to the bedrooms, walking through to a formal dining room adjacent to the kitchen and meals area. Access the rear through sliding doors opening out to your private rear yard perfect for pottering around, enjoying the evening sun or for a small pet. The first bedroom has a built in robe and a walk in robe to the second. The bathroom has a full size bath, shower and separate toilet. A major feature this property offers is a double lock up garage, pretty much unseen in unit sales today. There is scope for further improvements whether it be immediately or down the track in your own time.
The property is situated on approximately 210 square metres of land which is uncommonly large in today's day and age of medium and high density development.
An amenity rich location rounds out the pleasing package. Youre within close proximity to local shopping including the Burnt Bridge and the recently renovated Eastland, local buses with rail links, quality schools such as Luther College and Yarra Valley Grammar plus a number of parks, reserves and open green spaces including Ainslie Park, Peter Vergers Reserve and the Mullum Mullum Creek Trail.","SOLD - $537,500","2
