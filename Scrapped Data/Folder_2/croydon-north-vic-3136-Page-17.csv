croydon-north-vic-3136,4 Yarra Road Croydon North VIC 3136,"Reside, restore, renovate or rebuild (STCA)
Well priced for its esteemed Birts Hill location, spacious dimensions and generous land parcel of 862 sq m approx., this renovated 4 bedroom character weatherboard has a lot to offer, located less than a kilometre from Croydon station and Main Street.
Perfectly comfortable as is, the single-level house with 2 living areas and a big backyard makes an ideal home or investment on almost a quarter of an acre, near McAdam Square shops and cafes, Luther College and Good Shepherd Primary School.
Astute renovators and tradespeople will realise the property's value and see its potential for reconfiguration or extension (STCA), perhaps adding an ensuite or unifying the kitchen and living areas.
Character homes in this area are often highly sought-after, so you could restore the heritage features and create a cohesive, period house. Alternatively, a brand new contemporary residence may be more your style, perhaps taking advantage of the property's rear northern orientation (also STCA).
- 862 sq m approx. in the Birts Hill precinct
- 4 bedroom single-storey house
- 2 living areas and 2 decks
