Sitting on 613m2 this 3 bedroom 2 bathroom home would make an ideal project for those with renovating know how.

The layout has the lounge/ dining room at the front of the home featuring a Coonara style wood fire. Around the corner is the kitchen and dinette. From here you can access the rear yard with cubby, garage and lawn. To the rear is the bedrooms and bathrooms one of which has been renovated. Outside is a large rear yard with garage and lawn area. So if you're looking for great value and are prepared to do the work this could be the one and definitely worth a closer look!

If you have been dreaming of a rural lifestyle but would still like the close proximity to the coast, schools and shops, then this is what you have been waiting for.

Set on Approx 10 hectares (Approx 25 Acres), there is the potential to build your own dream home or resurrect, renovate and extend the original Miners cottage. This property offers the best of both worlds. The large acreage gives you the feeling of being away from it all, but within minutes you can be on the beach, in Geelong or on the ferry to Melbourne. Zoned farming, the area is renowned for its fertile soil and there is plenty of scope for horse agistment and other hobby farming possibilities. Close by are several of the regions award winning wineries, restaurants and the Curlewis Golf Club. An idyllic lifestyle is guaranteed.","SOLD - $880,000","2
