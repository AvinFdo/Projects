white-hills-vic-3550,2 Watts Court White Hills VIC 3550,"Astute investor & family home seeker alert!
A fantastic family home is what you'll find when you step through the front door at this address, an attribute echoed throughout the property. Able to be entirely separated, 2 living zones include parent's lounge and a study or nursery, aptly positioned near the master bedroom.
Beautiful timber laminate floor leads the way across an open plan zone into the kitchen where a dishwasher, electric wall oven and gas cooktop can be put to work. Space for a full-size side by side fridge and freezer is a thoughtful inclusion here too. A generous supply of storage starts with the corner pantry and large linen cupboards. However, it doesn't end with walk-in and built-in robes for all 3 bedrooms or roomy ensuite vanity. Ducted heating and cooling add constant comfort.
Revel in year-round outdoor living, sheltered by an undercover alfresco area, cocooned within patio blinds or roll-up to catch the evening breeze. A double carport has cars covered and grants access to the big fenced backyard. The residence sits on just over 800m2, surrounded by a virtually mow-only blank canvas, ready for you to paint your own version of a picture-perfect garden. Offering shade for children at play and pets on a hot summer day, a few established trees are a welcome asset.
Even the location is family-friendly in a quiet court very close to pre- and primary schools, botanic gardens, shops, swimming pool, buses into Bendigo plus secondary college and multiple other conveniences.
A smart choice for an astute investor or savvy family home seeker, this property is sure to prove popular!","SOLD - $316,500","3
