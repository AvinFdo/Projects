white-hills-vic-3550,1/47 Weeroona Avenue White Hills VIC 3550,"Private Oasis in the Lake Precinct
Just a 3 minute stroll from the banks of Lake Weeroona, or 6 minute cycle and 7 by bus from the CBD, sits a surprisingly substantial 3 bedroom townhouse. Forget about paying for parking from the moment you move in, or offer your tenants the same incentive to be the most tempting rental on the list!
Ingenious planning has positioned this exceptional residence to capture morning sunlight in each of 3 wide front windows. Able to enclose rowdy playtime or late night movie watching behind doors, one of these is the lounge.
Equally thoughtful at the rear, where the meals area pervaded by winter sunshine is open to the kitchen. Large enough to easily encompass a lengthy dining suite, an average-sized one otherwise allows space for a home office or second sofa. Dishwasher, gas burners, electric oven, loads of cupboards and bench equips the kitchen very well for someone who truly loves to cook.
All 3 bedrooms contain built-in robes and the bathroom is situated centrally. Not only does the main bedroom own dual access to it, glass sliding doors features here, leading directly outside. Gas wall furnaces such as this one typically generate plenty of heat and ducted cooling is terrific in summer.
With minimal grounds to worry about, weekends are relatively work-free, thanks to highly appealing yet low maintenance landscaping. Private and mostly paved, the rear is reminiscent of a Mediterranean courtyard, with rendered walls and raised garden bed. A single garage also has pedestrian access to it.
So, what's not to love?
Currently tenanted until July 2019 at $350 per week.","SOLD - $360,500","3

white-hills-vic-3550,45A Weeroona Avenue White Hills VIC 3550,"WALK TO LAKE WEEROONA FROM THIS CHARMING VICTORIAN HOME
This character-filled Victorian home is just a one-minute walk to beautiful Lake Weeroona and also walking distance to bus stops, sporting grounds, high school, childcare, cafes and more. Positioned on a large allotment, the charming property includes many original features including timber flooring, 12-foot ceilings, decorative cornice and ceiling roses, brick fireplaces, dado railing and dado boards.

Off the lounge is a large dining area that leads into a sunny kitchen. The modern country style of the kitchen perfectly suits the home and a glass sliding door opens out to the side garden.
From the lounge there is also a small hallway leading to a family bathroom, and steps from here down to a spacious laundry and a door opening out to the rear garden.
A paved courtyard can be found both at the side and the rear of the home, providing plenty of options for outdoor living. Meandering paths and garden beds lead through the garden to the storage or work shed at the rear of the allotment. Lovely established trees provide shade in the summer and the double carport includes a double gate and secure fencing.
Additional features include:
Ducted gas heating and evaporative cooling

white-hills-vic-3550,11 Yandong Street White Hills VIC 3550,"Fun, Fitness and Convenience from the doorstep
Classic mid-century residences remain ever-popular in this region for good reason. Built sturdy and strong, they bear intrinsic charm and frequently sought-after features.
Although fully refurbished in all areas that figure financially, thankfully architectural gems have been preserved here. Well-appreciated for their character and value, they endure as highlights beneath original terracotta roof tiles. Timber floors, 9'/2700mm ceilings lined with ornate cornices, picture rails and decorative pelmets have been retained, married harmoniously with new inclusions.
Now appointed with dishwasher and gas stove, storage and bench-space galore in timeless tones ice the cake in a modernized dine-in kitchen. The lounge has a gas heater, though ducted heating flows throughout, as does ducted cooling.
A smartly renovated bathroom and second loo off the laundry service 3 big bedrooms, 2 containing built-in robes.
Beyond the back verandah, an exquisite fairy-tale alfresco area sheltered under the profuse leafy roof of a gnarly ancient vine is a delightful focus. Also, within the family-sized backyard a massive old tree planted centre stage offers shade for kiddies and pets akin. There's a shed with roller door and concrete floor, a picturesque but robust red brick garage with room for a workbench and rainwater tank for flowerbeds too.
In actual fact a misnomer, the 'street' is a no-through road, with the bonus of parkland reserve plus shortcut to Weeroona College at the tail end. Stretching all the way between Bendigo, Axedale and Epsom, creek and rail trails just a few minutes' walk away add a lifestyle of convenience and fitness from your doorstep.","SOLD - $285,000","3

white-hills-vic-3550,68 Napoleon Crescent White Hills VIC 3550,"Art Deco Family Home (Circa 1947)!
TAWARRI is a two storey residence at White Hills which boasts a prime location overlooking Bendigo Botanic Gardens.
In 1947 the residence was designed and built by visionary Charlie Midgley for a local dentist.
Terry Clarke of Professionals said Tawarri bears more than a hint of post-war art deco styling and the sale presents a rare opportunity to own a unique example of Bendigo’s eclectic architectural history.
Tawarri has three living areas including formal lounge, separate sitting and a light-filled family room.
Kitchen updates include stone-topped work benches, Victorian ash cabinetry, free standing stainless steel range and multi-programmable Bosch dishwasher.
French-style doors are among the original features, as well as casement windows and genuine hardwood floors.
The home has formal entrance, central staircase, ensuite, bathroom, walk-in dressing room and executive-sized study (or fourth bedroom).
Most noteworthy are the upper-level bedrooms, each with a spacious balcony and views of the botanical gardens.
Terry said the home is on a garden allotment measuring more than 1000 square metres with dual access.
“There is potential for future subdivision and development, with council approval.”
The property has carporting, garage, work shed, crazy-paved patio and a 3.1-kilowatt solar system.
It is perfectly positioned near childcare, schools, transport, public pool, sport and leisure.","SOLD - $435,000","3

white-hills-vic-3550,6 Arbor Place White Hills VIC 3550,"Just what the family ordered!
Settled into a court, this youthful yet fully-established family home has all you need. Surprisingly under 4 kilometres from the city centre, it's also perfectly positioned to please busy mums and dads, tripping about between the plethora of priorities that come with parental bedlam!
Primary school is an 8 minute bike ride away, secondary just 13. Lake Weeroona a 30 minute wander and even puppy school is a few doors up the street! Bendigo Hospital is less than 3 kilometres for work or those inevitable expeditions to ER too!
Monochrome, minimalist styling allows whatever you wish to make your own dream decor come true here. Sleek sun-shades and blinds bring bright natural light indoors or shelter from summer's swelter, an efficient way to save energy!
Opposite master bedroom, the study would make an excellent temporary nursery using a screen. Appointed with good-sized walk-in robe, the main bedroom also has an unusual ensuite lay-out permitting a larger shower. Near the big family bathroom, 2 children's bedrooms have built-in robes.
Visually encompassing the hallway greatly expands lounge dimensions, leading through to open family zone. Lack of passageways reduces cost of running ducted heating and cooling. In a well-designed kitchen with dishwasher, gas cooktop and electric oven, an island breakfast bar is dedicated to casual meals and preparation rather than show-casing the sink.
Supplying ample space to play and entertain undercover of a generous alfresco area within a compact fenced yard, double garage, landscaping and more will no doubt add to having this home sold very soon!","SOLD - $380,000","3
