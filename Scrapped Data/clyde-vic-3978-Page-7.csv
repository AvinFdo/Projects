clyde-vic-3978,31/1531 Ballarto Road Clyde VIC 3978,"NO PROGRESS PAYMENTS! TOP LOCATION!
Located in the prestigious leafy suburb of Clyde, perfectly positioned between both a thriving city and stunning parklands, Parkview on Clyde offers the perfect combination of community and location.
With Melbourne's vibrant city just 48.1kms away, and Shopping on Clyde down the road, residents have plenty of options when it comes to shopping and dining out. A reliable bus and purposed future train network all within walking distance, making travelling to and from the estate a breeze.
This welcoming community offers a wide range of amenities and activities to enjoy, whilst being close to all the local conveniences you need to continue to live an active and low maintenance lifestyle.
A uniquely planned community, this terrific estate will cater to your every need!
Now is the time to take advantage of these quality townhouses which are ideal to live in or for investment.
The amazing benefits of these townhouses are as follows:
• Directly opposite Clyde Primary School
• Within walking distance to the Proposed Clyde Town Centre and Clyde Train Station
• No progress payments
• No Plans for Body Corporate
• Fantastic Rental Income of $370 to $390 per week
• Maximum saving on stamp duty (conditions apply)
• Full advantage of tax depreciation
• Brand new property with upgraded inclusions
• Receive an additional $10,000 Government grant if you are a 1St home buyer
No progress payments!
This is a huge attraction and means up until completion, there will be no loan payments or any loss of money. For example, if you were to build a brand new house and land package with another builder, you will be paying progress payments and would be charged interest during the entire building stage. With Parkview On Clyde, this is not the case. All that is required is a 10% deposit once finance has been approved and the balance of money is only due once your townhouse is completed.
Once completed a tenant will be organised to move in.

clyde-vic-3978,37/1531 Ballarto Road Clyde VIC 3978,"NO PROGRESS PAYMENTS! TOP LOCATION!
Located in the prestigious leafy suburb of Clyde, perfectly positioned between both a thriving city and stunning parklands, Parkview on Clyde offers the perfect combination of community and location.
With Melbourne's vibrant city just 48.1kms away, and Shopping on Clyde down the road, residents have plenty of options when it comes to shopping and dining out. A reliable bus and purposed future train network all within walking distance, making travelling to and from the estate a breeze.
This welcoming community offers a wide range of amenities and activities to enjoy, whilst being close to all the local conveniences you need to continue to live an active and low maintenance lifestyle.
A uniquely planned community, this terrific estate will cater to your every need!
Now is the time to take advantage of these quality townhouses which are ideal to live in or for investment.
The amazing benefits of these townhouses are as follows:
• Directly opposite Clyde Primary School
• Within walking distance to the Proposed Clyde Town Centre and Clyde Train Station
• No progress payments
• No Plans for Body Corporate
• Fantastic Rental Income of $370 to $390 per week
• Maximum saving on stamp duty (conditions apply)
• Full advantage of tax depreciation
• Brand new property with upgraded inclusions
• Receive an additional $10,000 Government grant if you are a 1St home buyer
No progress payments!
This is a huge attraction and means up until completion, there will be no loan payments or any loss of money. For example, if you were to build a brand new house and land package with another builder, you will be paying progress payments and would be charged interest during the entire building stage. With Parkview On Clyde, this is not the case. All that is required is a 10% deposit once finance has been approved and the balance of money is only due once your townhouse is completed.
Once completed a tenant will be organised to move in.
