kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,22 Sundew Drive Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Spacious contemporary family home on fantastic block
Situated just two minutes drive from all the amenities on offer at Lansell Square, and positioned high on a quiet street surrounded by attractive new builds, is this stunning modern family home.
Set back on a spacious block of over 2200 square metres, this beautifully presented property offers a modern façade and great curb appeal with a landscaped front garden, wide circular gravel drive and extensive slate paving leading to the front entry.
The home, a Paul Connell build, opens into an entry hall, which leads to left into the first of four bedrooms the property provides. With a built-in robe and ceiling fan, the position of this room allows it to make a fantastic study or home office. Next is the spacious master bedroom with ceiling fan, generously-proportioned walk-through robe and a large ensuite with double shower, double vanity and toilet.
To the right of the entry is a large formal lounge with a gas log fire, complementing the evaporative ducted heating and cooling found throughout the property.
Heading down the hallway is access to the kid’s retreat, featuring a ceiling fan, sliding doors, and windows with built-in plantation shutters allowing for privacy and the easy ability to check in on the kids if needed.
Beyond this space is a great sized open plan kitchen, living and dining room.
The modern kitchen features a huge island bench, five-burner gas cooktop, 900mm oven, dishwasher and spacious walk-in pantry. Ample storage and contemporary fittings add to the appeal, alongside additional conveniences such as a ducted vacuum system.
Behind the kitchen is a huge laundry with built-in cupboards and a large walk-in linen closet, along with a door providing access to the side of the house. Next to the laundry is secure access to the double garage.
Off the dining room is a hallway leading to two bedrooms – both with ceiling fans and built-in robes. A powder room, triple linen cupboard and family bathroom complete the family-friendly design.
From the dining room are two glass sliding doors providing access to the al fresco area and the outdoor space beyond. The entertaining space is under the roofline and features a ceiling fan, TV point, power and a fantastic brick fireplace.
The fully fenced area of the rear garden is the perfect play zone for young children and beyond the entertaining space is an additional sun deck.
Through a gate and down steps to the rear of the block is a fantastic space offering plenty of potential. Towards the end of the long driveway is a triple garage with two roller doors and a tank behind the shed.
The driveway is wide enough for a truck to easily enjoy access to the rear of the property and there is plenty of room at the end of the block to easily turn. At the very rear of the property is tranquil private bush land.
This fantastic family home has plenty to offer and is ideal for a buyer wanting a modern home in spacious surrounds that is close to schools, shops and more.","SOLD - $604,000","4

Everything is already done for you here. The home has been completely refurbished inside and out. Some of the improvements include new kitchen, updated bathroom, new carpets and floor coverings, freshly painted inside and out, new split system & a new instantaneous hot water service. The home has also been re-stumped, had new plumbing and the fuse box has been upgraded. It's also in a great position being handy to pre-schools, primary & secondary schools, shops such as IGA, Aldi, Coles, Woolworths plus Bunnings and numerous other retail shops, the new Aquatic Centre (opening in 2018) & walking tracks along Bendigo Creek.
Sitting behind a picket fence, the home comprises three bedrooms with ceiling fans, new kitchen with plenty of cupboards & bench space, dishwasher, side by side gas oven & cooktop, large fridge space with views over the rear yard. Adjacent is the very comfortable carpeted lounge with gas space heater, split system and ceiling fan. The bathroom has been updated and has shower over bath, new vanity and heat lamps for those chilly mornings. A separate toilet is located near the laundry which has good storage and access to the rear yard.
Stepping outside, the grassed rear yard is large enough for kids or pets to play with low maintenance gardens and a brick shed with concrete floor and power. There is also a single carport for the car accommodation.

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,4 Freeman Drive Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Immaculate family home in sought-after location
Just 4 doors from the local primary school and not much more to Crusoe College, this fabulous family home truly does have it all! Built 5 years ago to renowned high standards of Paul Gray, it has the space, inclusions and even the extras to make every member of the family vote in favour of purchasing this please-all property.
Located between 2 living zones, a thoroughly modern immaculate kitchen sits, with symmetry to well-please the eye. A 900mm stove is flanked by broad banks of pot drawers and pendant lights focus on a feature island breakfast bar with granite waterfall bench.
A luxuriously spacious walk-in robe in the master bedroom leads into an ensuite, with extra-large showers found both here as well as in the family bathroom. All 4 bedrooms are huge, the other 3 have built-in robes and attic storage with built-in ladder access is yet another bonus.
Complete comfort from ducted heating and cooling comes alongside a vast reduction in energy expenses via 3kW solar system plus solar hot water. Rainwater tank connected to toilets adds another sustainable resource and cost saving.
As expected, there a double garage with direct entry indoors. But there's also a lockable shed on a concrete base with power plus plenty of room for hobby enthusiasts. An irrigated lawn winds its way around the residence, alfresco dining area and landscaped grounds.
Nearby bushland reserves, shopping, train station and easy highway access place this property in prime position for investors and home seekers alike.","SOLD - $448,950","4
