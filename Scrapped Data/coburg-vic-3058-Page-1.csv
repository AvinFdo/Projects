coburg-vic-3058,38 Elizabeth Street Coburg VIC 3058,"Luxurious Family Living
Meticulously renovated with an eye for style and excellence in quality and craftsmanship, upgrade to a higher standard of living with this bright and stylish family home.
Enhanced with contemporary finishes and featuring generous living spaces, relaxed outdoor entertaining and the flexibility of four bedrooms and three living zones, it's a home that delivers the space and style your growing family craves on a glorious 667sqm (approx.) fully landscaped garden allotment.
Being on the elevated side of the road and with a high fence and large front garden, this property provides a superior level of privacy and outlook. The essence of peace and tranquillity extends to the park-like backyard featuring beautiful established gardens, a manicured lawn for children to play, an undercover alfresco for year-round entertaining and a large open-air setting ideal for star-gazing around a fire pit.
Back inside, stretch out and relax in the welcoming living area set against a soothing leafy outlook, and feel inspired with your sleek gourmet kitchen, which boasts commercial grade Neil Perry appliances (Italian made oven, stovetop, rangehood, rotisserie), ASKO stainless steel dishwasher, stone surfaces, plenty of soft close storage space and a large Velux skylight for an endless stream of natural light.
For the ultimate wow factor, a spectacular family bathroom is every bit the celebration of modern design, instantly impressing with its chic bluestone tiling, floating timber vanity, on-trend black tapware, frameless walk-in shower and extra large Victoria + Albert volcanic limestone freestanding bath as its stylish centrepiece.
A bright rear rumpus room can function as a games retreat for the kids, while flexibility is an asset with the large fourth bedroom. Boasting its own bathroom, laundry and private entry, it can accommodate the privacy-craving teenager or extended family members or be converted into a large home office for the working parent.
A further three bedrooms are of generous proportions (all newly carpeted), while a large basement cellar, single garage, additional off-street car space with new 2m high automatic sliding gate, evaporative cooling, ducted heating and polished timber floorboards add another layer of positive appeal.
Enriching your living experience is the family-oriented location, which is within short walking distance of Coburg Hill Shopping Centre, the Merri Creek Trail, transport, Coburg High School, Preston Market, Coburg Lake, swimming pool, Coburg drive in, Sydney Road shops as well as moments from Pentridge Shopping Precinct which will include shopping, dining, a cinema and much more.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"4

Parents will relish the luxury of a fully-tiled 5-star ensuite in which a black-butt timber vanity is appointed with twin basins and where under-floor heating is a welcome friend in the winter months. Impressive birch-ply walk-in robes are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also wonderfully functional, while 3 of the remaining bedrooms are appointed with substantial 2 pac cabinetry built-in robes.
Meanwhile, families will value the flexibility offered by a separate, traditional lounge room that is arranged around its gas-converted open fire place.

*Due to Melbourne's Stage 4 Restrictions, all Nelson Alexander team members are working from home. Please contact us via email or phone to speak about your options to view this property virtually. Thank you. *
Retaining the distinctive character and allure of its industrial origins, this converted warehouse delivers a uniquely stylish and secluded inner-urban lifestyle with its impressive dimensions, quality inclusions and reassuringly secure surrounds. High ceilings across both levels, the home's serene interior comprises two upstairs bedrooms (large master with WIR and sunny balcony) accompanied by a stylish two-way bathroom with frameless shower and floor-to-ceiling tiles, as well as a downstairs guest powder room (second WC). Adding to its appeal is the open-plan living/dining area that's both spacious and versatile complemented by a well-appointed kitchen complete with Ariston appliances (dishwasher, oven and gas cooktop). Other stand-out features of this cool conversion include split-system heating and cooling, additional ceiling fans (dining area and both bedrooms), plus intercom/secure entry and undercover parking space. Completing the picture is a fully-decked private rear courtyard which backs onto one of Pentridge's signature bluestone walls. A short stroll to the open spaces of Coburg Lake Reserve and endless trails along leafy Merri Creek, it's also close to local schools and childcare services, along with Sydney Road trams, cafes, Coburg Station and renowned shopping precinct.

Few studios beguile like this newly renovated two-bedroom ground floor Coburg apartment.
Beautifully positioned in a private street at the heart of Pentridge Village and its historic legacy, the apartments unique floor plan, meticulous design flourishes and fantastic inner-city location make this up-and-coming cultural hotspot an exceptional scoop for professional singles, couples and investors alike.
For starters, the residence is full of thoughtful touches. Think carpeted bedrooms with built-in robes and grandiose windows; laminate timber flooring in the living areas; sparkling stone benchtops and extensive gleaming white cabinetry forming the immaculate kitchen; and a quiet study nook, on the opposite side to the bedrooms to ensure work and rest are separate.
But its the soaring high ceilings and immense panoramic windows that truly set the scene. Bringing the outdoors indoors and bathing its interiors in waves of natural light, each instantly transforms what couldve been a standard run-of-the-mill apartment into a striking and palatial pad that surprises and delights.
Topping it all off is the apartments exquisite location. Just moments from Coburg Farmers Market, Pentridge Cellars and the Glass Den cafe, and within walking distance of the Merri Creek parklands, Coburg Lake, public transport and Sydney Roads array of shops, cafes and restaurants, your every want or whim is within easy reach.","SOLD - $445,000","2
