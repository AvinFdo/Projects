The immaculately presented home is positioned beautifully on the block to make the most of the warm northerly aspect with the kitchen and living areas designed to overlook the vast green lawn and garden. The kitchen is well appointed with great storage and plenty of bench space and is central to both living areas which makes entertaining a breeze. From the main living area a sliding door opens to a private and covered alfresco area overlooking the tranquil environment.
The master bedroom has a fabulous dressing room and great size ensuite while the remaining two bedrooms and family bathroom are located off the main living area to the rear of the home. The living area has a cosy wood fire, split system heating and cooling and carpet throughout providing a really relaxing space.
Outdoors the property is fully fenced with double gates for access to a single carport and a concrete driveway leads to the double garage with remote control doors. There is also a storage shed at the rear.
With the shops, beaches and schools only minutes away and only a short walk to the RSL, this property presents an amazing opportunity and would suit as a great coastal permanent home or weekend retreat!","SOLD - $570,000","3
