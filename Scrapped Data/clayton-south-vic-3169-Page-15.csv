clayton-south-vic-3169,4 Bronwyn Court Clayton South VIC 3169,"Develop Your Future On The Footsteps Of Heatherton Park
Backing onto Heatherton Park in a coveted top-of-the-court location, it's easy to feel inspired to create something truly special with this potential-rich three-bedroom home.
Occupying a grand allotment of 677.7sqm (Approx), it's the chance of a lifetime to develop a collection of ultra-contemporary townhouses (STCA) in a sought-after location or start afresh with a brand new luxury home that could frame a spectacular scenic view across the neighbouring parkland (STCA).
An existing three-bedroom home currently resides on the flat allotment, and with an updated kitchen with gas appliances, two bathrooms, radiant open-plan living, warm timber flooring, loads of natural light, evaporative cooling, ducted heating, double lock-up garage, alfresco entertaining and a huge backyard, it's a great place to raise the kids or lease out whilst plans and permits are being approved.
A recently developed children's playground on council land at the rear of the property will be a hit with the kids, while convenient access to Westall and Springvale train stations, buses, schools and shops adds further appeal to this life-changing opportunity.
