kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,86 Browning Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Fully renovated family home
Recently redesigned in sophisticated contemporary style, this property has been superbly upgraded on every level, not merely cosmetic. Repainted, recarpeted, new floating timber floors and window furnishings only begin the list of refurbishments. A stunning kitchen surrounds a Miele dishwasher and 900mm stove, incorporating small appliance cupboard and soft-close cabinetry. Stainless steel ceiling fans, along with ducted gas heating and evaporative cooling, maintain temperatures in 2 living zones and 4 bedrooms. Opposite the main, the 4th bedroom makes an ideal quiet study or nursery. A rather suave ensuite has an extra-large shower, as well as abundant built-in storage which is a feature found right throughout the interior. Even the laundry has been thoroughly planned from hampers to high cupboards to keep chemicals out of reach from little hands.
Able to cover quite a gathering, an immense alfresco entertaining area is also a huge addition to the home as sheltered outdoor living, providing a sun-safe place to relax and play. Keeping kiddies and furrier family members safe, the yard is fully-fenced and other secluded garden nooks offer quiet retreats too. Grounds are aptly landscaped to suit busy modern lifestyles and local weather conditions. Sensibly positioned, the double carport over the front door with a bee-line to the kitchen is perfect for grocery shopping, and the 5.5x3.7 metre shed is handy for varied hobbies. It's just a short walk to school, college and bus into shopping, train station, CBD, sports, community and medical facilities. Reap all the rewards of an outstanding rejuvenation - simply inspect, purchase and move in!","SOLD - $370,000","4

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,277 Allingham Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"ARTISTIC CHARM INSIDE AND OUT
Hidden from from the outside world behind a tall fence and serene garden, this solid-brick, two-storey home oozes character, warmth and eclectic style.
It offers two bedrooms and a bathroom on the upper level with main bedroom, renovated bathroom and extensive living areas on the ground floor.
Every room enjoys tranquil garden views – none more so than the formal lounge with big windows and a glazed door opening to the front garden. A lofty raked ceiling creates drama and a sense of space while high double-glazed windows fill the room with natural light and stained glass windows add a creative touch.
An inviting dining room lies beside the updated kitchen with its ample cabinetry, benches, gas cooktop, under-bench electric oven, dishwasher, walk-in pantry and cleverly concealed European-style laundry.
Large main bedroom is situated behind the bathroom and includes big walk-in robe, an extra cupboard with shelving and a glass door to the side garden.
A large study/second living room at the rear is lined with bookshelves and includes a cheery gas-log fire under a timber mantelpiece and access to the expansive private alfresco entertaining area. Be both impressed and de-stressed by the peaceful ambience under the vine-draped pergola overlooking productive vegetable gardens and fruit trees.
A spacious studio off the side courtyard is a work of art itself with plenty of natural light, sink with water for quick cleanups and canvas storage racks. Alternatively, it could be utilised as a teen retreat, workshop, office or rumpus/playroom.
Added external features include carport, two rainwater tanks with pumps and sprinkler system, chook run, 1.5Kw solar power.
Like the seasons, the garden is an ever-changing canvas of colour and form where you can lose yourself amid the stately ghost gums with colourful under plantings, paved sitting areas, meandering paths and tranquil fishponds.
Filled with artistic charm, this property is the perfect hideaway while still handy to Kangaroo Flat Railway Station, shops and Lansell Square shopping centre.","SOLD - $402,500","3

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,30 Magellan Crescent Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Living the high life!
Taking full advantage of panoramic views spanning city rooftops and forest canopies, this impeccably presented property awaits your inspection. Perched upon an oversized double garage that also encompasses a storeroom and plenty of workshop space, the residence is wrapped on 3 sides by a return verandah to enable further enjoyment of the vista. Double doors are an aptly grand entrance to an interior that perfectly combines a little grandeur with a welcoming family environment. Enormous living zones feature bay windows that frame the scenery and are attired in timeless new window furnishings. They share ducted natural gas heating as well as evaporative cooling with 3 big bedrooms and a study. Beyond the breakfast bar, a dishwasher and 900mm stainless steel stove indulge the cook in the convenience of modern appliances. As expected, the master bedroom has an ensuite and walk-in robe, while other bedrooms contain built-in robes. The study as a potential 4th, nursery or guest room is a huge bonus, but it's ideally positioned for a home office or to supervise kid's internet usage. Landscaped grounds surround the home and incorporate a charming pond and built-in barbeque area. Ample room in the garage allows garden tools to be locked away at the end of the day. School, college and bus stops are just around the corner and shopping is within walking distance. Commuters will also appreciate the proximity to both the train station and highways. This lengthy list of attributes makes it highly likely that, unless you book your inspection now, 'those that snooze lose!'","SOLD - $435,000","3
