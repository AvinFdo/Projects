coronet-bay-vic-3984,1028 Coast Road French Island VIC 3921,"ENTRY LEVEL OPPORTUNITY! BE QUICK
Let your creative juices flow at 'Koala Station', a character filled, quaint and quirky weatherboard cottage comprising polished floorboards, cathedral ceilings, wood heater, gas cook top and oven, one large master bedroom and a two bedroom train carriage positioned off the platform-styled rear deck
Also includes a large colorbond shed, 2 large rainwater tanks, a kids tree-house, some maze-like tracks through the bush-garden and the restored train carriage. An added bonus is plenty of fire-wood already cut with lots more wood on the property and some vehicles for use on the property.
Ideal as an artists hideaway and/or as a base from which to travel.
French Island is approximately two thirds national park and is unincorporated, therefore is not governed by a local council, so no council rates apply. Being off the grid, means there are no power companies to deal with and no water rates to pay. About an hour from Melbourne, but like stepping back in time, we are a small community of around 100 residents, accessible by passenger ferry from Stony Point, or vehicle barge from Corinella.
Please contact Phil on 5980 1234 to discuss this unique opportunity.","SOLD - $385,000","3
