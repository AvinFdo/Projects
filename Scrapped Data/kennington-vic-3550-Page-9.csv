kennington-vic-3550,28 Marshall Crescent Kennington VIC 3550,"Hard work reaps the rewards
This classic cream double brick home requires a buyer who can look beyond the dated interior and lack of TLC to see the huge potential.
No doubt, there is work to be done, but effort will reap the rewards.
Comprising of 5 bedroom plus study, double storey residence represents an incredible opportunity.
Distinctive architecture of the era continues to endear for good reason and is found here across both levels. As anticipated, hardwood floors stretch out beneath nine-foot ceilings lined with decorative cornices. A tiled hearth currently employs a gas heater where a gas log-fire would look most welcome. Spacious rooms with large windows are framed in timber and topped with pelmets. Glass sliding internal doors with timber details and architraves, as well as glass cabinets, serveries in kitchenette and the huge kitchen, semi-separate yet connect some rooms.
Ideal for student accommodation or eventual redesign for a fabulous family home, both floors have bathrooms. Upstairs currently has a large lounge and kitchen, with the downstairs kitchenette and narrow living area inspiring ideas for an open plan family room. Outdoor living can be enjoyed upon the balcony or broad terrace above the big garden shed and there's a double tandem garage. Walk to shopping centres, recreation and bushland reserves, dinner and live bands, CBD, parks, pool and sports, schools, college and uni or catch nearby buses.
Unique properties like this rarely become available.

The kitchen boasts solid Blackwood cabinetry with electric cooktop, double oven, dishwasher and walk-in pantry while the family room features built-in wall unit, gas heating and air conditioning. In-house vaccuum is a valuable addition to the property. A rear vestibule/mud room and large laundry include good storage with bench space for a sewing/hobby nook while a rear verandah offers a quiet place to sit and enjoy the serene environs.
A beautiful Merbau timber staircase rises to the upper level sleeping quarters with four bedrooms, (BIR) and family bathroom with separate shower room, WC and vanity. The main suite includes walk-through robes to full ensuite.
Outside, the auto double garage has direct access to the family room and the private, terraced back garden includes bluestone retaining walls and a unique back fence made of recycled granite bricks salvaged from the old tramways.
