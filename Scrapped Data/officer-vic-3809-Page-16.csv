Even though it's not located in Bonnie Doon the titled block is situated in the next best place - Heathfield Estate in Officer.
Just a smidge under 400sqm, the block features a 12.5 metre frontage and minimal fall.
Have I spoken about the vibe yet? Do yourself a favour and take a drive to the block. With captivating views over to the Western Port Bay you're also walking distance to St Brigid's Primary School, public transport and Officer's main strip of shops.
What a great place to build your first home or kick-off your investment portfolio. Who knows, you could even build your own pool room.","SOLD - $315,000",399m²,Vacant land,Sold by private treaty 1 Oct 2019,"24 Ambleside Way, Officer VIC 3809 was last sold in 2019.","ALL
