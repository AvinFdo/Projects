docklands-vic-3008,107/60 Siddeley Street Docklands VIC 3008,"Absolute Yarra River Frontage
This uniquely positioned 3 bedroom apartment delivers the wow factor on so many levels. Yes, there's the river which you really need to come and check out for yourself because there's nothing quite like the soothing sensation of watching this iconic waterway from your own living or bedroom. The home itself flows as serenely as the river with an inclusive open plan living space that effortlessly accommodates dining, entertaining and tranquil relaxation and is sure to be the scene of great times with loved ones and friends. Overseeing your living area, and also looking out to the river, is a wonderfully practical and contemporary kitchen that gives you stone benchtops, dishwasher, gas cooktop and all the storage space you will ever need. You have the extravagance of three bedrooms. Two of these are generously proportioned and feature built in robes with one enjoying, you guessed it, that amazing river view. Then there's the master, I'm not going to call it a bedroom, but more of a suite. There is ample room here for your most luxurious bed but you also have the ability to create a true retreat with study or alternative leisure zone, with river view, a serious option. Then it's through to the massive walk in robe and into your glorious fully tiled ensuite with sumptuous bathtub, roomy shower and stylish everything. Wow! The central bathroom is just as impressive and the exceptional amenity is completed by a tastefully integrated European laundry.
The feeling inside your new home couldn't be more peaceful but this belies that fact that you are an easy walk, along the river boardwalk if you wish, to everything you love about Melbourne. You can see the casino complex from your front door and you have a plethora of public transport options at your fingertips. Just as well you have your own secure space to leave your car. You will have full use of the pool, spa, sauna, steam room and gymnasium as well as secure intercom entry.
