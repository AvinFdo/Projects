coburg-vic-3058,1 Florence Street Coburg VIC 3058,"Character, Position and Promise
Brimming with promise this four bedroom Art Deco retains details of its era and opens up enticing possibilities on generous land of approximately 603m2. In addition to a living room there's a central kitchen/meals, versatile tiled area that would make a handy study, large covered outdoor area for alfresco dining and a deep rear lawn that's practically a blank canvas. High ceilings with decorative details add character, most bedrooms are large and the bathroom is in a central position. A side driveway takes care of parking and there's a big workshop and storage area, but the greatest potential lies in the range of opportunities presented to inspired buyers: consider renovating, extending, building new or further developing the site (subject to council approval). There's plenty to recommend the position: in a cul-de-sac near a great range of transport including trains, trams and buses, it's also close to Anderson Reserve, schools and the many shops, cafes and restaurants of cosmopolitan Sydney Road.","SOLD - $1,140,000","4
