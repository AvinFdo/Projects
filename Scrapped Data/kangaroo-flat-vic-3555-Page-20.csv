kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,4/21 John Street Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Contemporary-style relaxation and convenience
Wise words of Benjamin Franklin in practice, 'a place for everything and everything in its place', is embodied by this 2-year-old property. Impeccably presented, stunning timber floors bring welcome contrast and visual warmth to the decor. Highly efficient, the 1 bedroom plus study floorplan has no hallways to waste expenditure on unutilised energy, by not heating and cooling unused spaces.
This is evident in the European-style laundry and galley kitchen, where quality fittings and finishes include stone benchtops and a sleek ceramic glass cooktop. As well as a light-filled living-dining room, there is a substantial computer room for use as a home office. Lit by an interior window during the day, a spacious shower-room also contains the toilet and vanity. Reverse cycle air-conditioning sustains continuous relief from external temperatures.
A complete wall of built-in robes supplies sufficient storage in the bedroom and a glass sliding door provides a second entry point into the rear courtyard. Backing onto crown-owned bushland bestows a beautiful backdrop to barbeques. Entirely landscaped grounds in attractive yet easy to care for fashion makes life even more restful at this address. An extra-wide single carport has your vehicle covered too.
This surprisingly handy location is within 8 to 20 minutes stroll of shopping, sports club, leisure centre, pub, medical facilities, train station and much more. Bus stops are around the corner, Bendigo is just 5 kilometres away, Melbourne under 150 into the CBD.
It's a townhouse that truly encapsulates a lifestyle of relaxation and convenience.","SOLD - $233,000","1

kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,6 Edmund Court Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"Views, gardens and a sense of grandeur
From behind a veil of fully established leafy green garden emerges a beautiful family home with views across the treetops. Quality built, the double brick, split level residence is impeccably presented and has been meticulously maintained throughout its life. There’s a sense of grandeur about this home, perhaps it’s the wide stairway to the upper level, maybe it’s the airy open plan design, I’m not sure but whatever it is just adds to the wow factor.
With a list a features sure to impress including:
• Two light filled living areas. A spacious main living area with views of the beautiful surrounding gardens and beyond. The second living area is a bit cosier and a great space to retreat to.
• A modern kitchen, complete with stainless steel electric oven, electric cooktop and dishwasher and plenty of cupboards and bench space.
• A dining room with a view and access to an outdoor entertaining area.
• Three bedrooms. The main bedroom has three floor to ceiling built-in robes, ensuite and French style doors to access the private backyard. The remaining two bedrooms are on the upper level. Both have built-in robes and are easily able to accommodate a queen bed ensemble.
• A study with a huge storage cupboard and a convenient bathroom for the lower level.
• The upper level has the main bathroom with shower, vanity and children’s bath. This level also has the laundry and access to the backyard.
• Ducted evaporative cooling and gas ducted heating maintain the climate control and a gas log fire heater in the main lounge is an additional option for cooler nights.
The 889m2 allotment is completely landscaped but is very low maintenance. Solar panels keep the cost of energy at bay and a water tank connected to the bathroom keeps water consumption to a minimum.
Located on the Melbourne side of Bendigo at the end of a private court within walking distance of the new Gurri Wanyarra Wellbeing Centre. Close to walking tracks, primary and secondary schools, medical practices, Lansell Square Shopping Centre, Kangaroo Flat Train Station and less than a 10-minute drive to Central Bendigo.","SOLD - $410,000","3
