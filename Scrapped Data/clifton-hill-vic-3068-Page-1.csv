clifton-hill-vic-3068,29-31 John Street Clifton Hill VIC 3068,"Rare adjoining balcony terraces with scope offered as one
Side-by-side on the one title at the north-end of an historic Boom-era row, these 2 adjoining balcony terraces equal a decidedly rare double feature in the heart of Clifton Hill. Offered as one on a combined 260 sqm allotment (approx.) with side ROW vehicle access, these 2 double-storey Victorians (1888) stand solid and ready for a range of options to suit a number of future scenarios. Imagine the possibilities STCA: one luxuriously renovated double-fronted residence, 2 separate restored homes (keep one and work in, sell or rent out the other) or 2 rewarding rental properties to boost a savvy investment portfolio. Either way, this is an extraordinary 2-in-1 opportunity with unparalleled potential in a prime inner-city position. As currently presented with views to the city skyline, the connected 11-room interior includes arched hallways, large kitchen, 2 bathrooms, 2 powder rooms, high ceilings, keyless entry and hydronic heating. The open rear garden includes space for off-street parking while the location is superb near parks, gardens and trails, Queens Parade and city-fringe shopping precincts, train station, trams and schools.","SOLD - $1,710,000","10
