drysdale-vic-3222,45 Banks Road Drysdale VIC 3222,"The Best of Both Worlds and Water Views
With a spectacular outlook from every window in this Architectually designed home and Situated only moments from Drysdale's main shopping centre & Point Lonsdale and Ocean Grove sandy beaches is a rare opportunity to purchase 5 glorious acres in one of the most fertile areas of the Bellarine Peninsula.
Found on a beautifully quiet road surrounded by open fields this spacious home ensures that every room has a view of either the natural landscape or the panoramic vista across Port Philip Bay, Swan bay to Queenscliff and beyond. From the entry, the main lounge and dining rooms enjoy this view from full walls of windows and also boast an open fire place in the centre of the room and a fully functioning bar to one end.
The hub of the home is definitely the enormous country style, timber kitchen with walk in pantry and vintage wood stove but also contains a more modern gas cooktop and stainless steel electric oven. The open family meals and living rooms are situated here as well with further walls of glass opening onto a paved entertaining area and overlooking the property to the line of towering pine trees & wood lot to the north.
4 large sized bedrooms, (king sized master with walk in robe almost the size of a bedroom itself, and equally spacious ensuite with double vanity and shower plus separate wc, all opening onto a private courtyard fernery) lie in a wing of their own that boasts a uniquely shaped (to also capture views) rumpus room and study/fourth bedroom plus family bathroom, vast laundry, wc and additional powder room for guests.
The home is heated by solid fuel, reverse cycle heating/cooling, large open fireplace in formal lounge, woodfire canara in main living, gas heater (in the rumpus) but has been cleverly designed to capture sun in winter and remain cool in summer. Stunning slate floors and exposed timber ceilings (some cathedral), provide an ambience that is distinctly suited to the surrounds but also has the potential to be modernised for a more contemporary feel.
The property will please all members of the family with horse paddocks and stables, a triple car brick garage with ample storage and additional shedding with concrete, power and water which could be used as an additional studio, further accomodaion or work-shop shed.. Tank water services the home with an abundance of storage that has never run out even with a full household in the worst drought conditions. The established gardens and the HUGE variety of fruit treesYour dream of self sustainable living could easily become a reality here.
- 5 acres approx.
- Panoramic water views
- 33 squares of living (approx.)
- Abundant garaging and shedding
- Close to Ocean Grove beaches, Drysdale and Point Lonsdale
