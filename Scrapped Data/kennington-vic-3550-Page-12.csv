Stepping up to the entry, the style and grandeur of the property is apparent and as you come in the front door, the detail of the architecture is beautifully displayed. Split level living; combined with high, vaulted ceilings with exposed timber beams and floor-to-ceiling windows all add to the appeal of the main living space.

An inground swimming pool, complete with water slide, can be easily observed from the alfresco area, and a generous lawn and established trees in garden beds complete the side garden.
