kennington-vic-3550,3 Clarence Avenue Kennington VIC 3550,"Neat Brick Veneer in Popular Area
Situated on a good size block this comfortable three bedroom house has everything you need. Of brick veneer and tiled roof construction the home has been well maintained and cared for. It has been freshly painted internally, in neutral tones, which make it bright and airy throughout.
The three generous bedrooms, all at the back of the house, have built in robes which feature new timber doors. The lounge room is a good size (5.9 x 4.5m) and has a gas wall heater. The lounge opens into the meals area which then flows into the galley style kitchen. The kitchen has a gas stove, large pantry and breakfast bar with overhead glass display cupboard. The wet areas are cleverly designed down this side of the house with the laundry and external door accessible from the kitchen. There is a pristine three piece family bathroom centrally located between the three bedrooms and a separate toilet.
Outside there are immaculate gardens and expanses of lawn. Undercover parking is available with a single carport attached to the house but there is also the advantage of a separate concrete driveway leading to a 6x4m galvanised shed with power and concrete that could be another garage or workshop. There is also a 1m x1.5 galvanised garden shed with concrete floor.
Kennington itself is a popular area with access to the CBD, primary and secondary schools, recreation and medical facilities and plenty of shopping.
Overall, this home will appeal to a variety of buyers- investors, first home buyers or retirees.

kennington-vic-3550,10 The Strand Kennington VIC 3550,"The address says it all
Unlike it's namesake, the busy London thoroughfare, Bendigo's version of The Strand is a quiet, sleepy street conveniently located between the city and Strath Village.
Established in the seventies, homes in the area have eternal appeal and this one is no exception.
Held by the same owner for the past 27 years, it oozes charm, comfort and convenience and has been meticulously maintained and updated inside and out.
Features include a welcoming entry hall leading to three robed bedrooms (main with ensuite), spacious lounge and dining rooms with gas heating and split system air conditioning. Large main bathroom, ample storage options and a well-appointed solid timber kitchen and adjoining meals area opening to a sun-drenched and vine-covered alfresco deck. Enjoy Sunday brunch overlooking paved sitting nooks and the delightful established gardens where sprigs of spring are beginning to show. A double carport, garden shed and rainwater tank complete the outside.
One of Bendigo's premier locations, the prestigious pocket is close enough to walk to Coles supermarket, pharmacy, doctor and public transport with Strath Village and the CBD a short drive away.
With a classical past and a promising future, the property has perfect potential for young couples, investors or golden oldies looking for a golden lifestyle. Call for an inspection today.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"3
