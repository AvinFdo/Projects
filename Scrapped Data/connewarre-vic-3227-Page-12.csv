On offer here in the exclusive Grange Park Estate, is this magnificent property which offers 2,790m2 of private residential land.
From the moment you drive up the semi-circular, tree-lined driveway and park in front of this imposing, landmark property, you know you are in a special place. The grand, homestead-style, two-storey house surrounded by impressive landscaping is accompanied, by a fully self-contained, classy bungalow, triple-car garage previously used as a hair studio and a massive 10x9m shed to the rear of the property perfect for the boat, caravan or motorhome.
This property surprises at every turn. The house has been refreshed and updated from top to bottom and presents as a perfect example of modern living. Downstairs offers three big bedrooms, family bathroom, spacious laundry, formal lounge room, theatre room with included surround sound, projector and seating, and an open-plan kitchen and dining. The kitchen has a great salute to yesteryear - an in-built, fully functional IXL No.5 slow-combustion stove and oven - alongside modern appliances. Just imagine the homestead-style warmth and the smell of freshly baked bread wafting throughout the house in the middle of winter. Five bi-fold glass doors open from the kitchen/dining area to a north-facing undercover deck, where fine dining and entertaining is a breeze. Alongside is another undercover area, featuring a six-person spa, built-in bar and barbecue space.
Upstairs is the main bedroom, with ensuite, and a wonderful parents' retreat/rumpus and adjoining study. A large balcony offers commanding views to the north over the backyard. Throughout the house, the quality of the build is obvious; Victorian Ash hardwood flooring alongside lush carpets, contemporary tiles ornate touches. Towards the rear of the property stands the self-contained bungalow, featuring an open plan kitchen/dining/living, a separate bedroom with built in robe and bathroom with separate toilet. The possibilities here are many; it could be a guest house, teenager's retreat, permanent accommodation for elderly relatives or even the perfect pool house for those with intentions of installing a pool in the expansive yard.
The free-standing garage - the design and build complementing the main house - has been adapted to cater for two vehicles alongside a hair salon with plumbing ready to go; return the space to cater for three vehicles or kit out the salon for whatever purpose you like. Of course, a swim at the famous Surf Coast beaches is only 15 minutes or so down the road.
The Waurn Ponds railway station is nearby, and major shopping centres are close at hand. This property, beautifully landscaped and a great example of an owner-built project, offers a rare chance to live a secluded, modern lifestyle with loads of space around you and all the advantages of being close to big-city facilities.
It has to be inspected to be appreciated.
