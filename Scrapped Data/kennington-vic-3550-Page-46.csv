Three bedrooms have built-in-robes; the main boasts a walk-in-robe and en suite, the laundry is a good size with plenty of storage and the family bathroom has been recently updated and includes a 900mm shower, separate bath, vanity and extensive tiling throughout.
There are colonial windows, ducted evaporative cooling throughout and Holland blinds, veranda's and privacy.
Outside is a double carport with room to open your doors, two water tanks and a superb barn-style shed! The shed boasts a sound-proof studio, mezzanine and a large man-cave style space with pot-belly heater and some lined walls.
This property has a bit of everything and is ripe for someone looking for some space. Only a short drive to Bendigo, the new Marist College is close by and you're very handy to the Maiden Gully shopping strip.
