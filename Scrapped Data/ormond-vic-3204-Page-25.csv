ormond-vic-3204,623 North Road Ormond VIC 3204,"Renovation Transformation With Family Focus
The generous proportions of this beautifully updated and extended Californian Bungalow are superbly configured for a lifestyle of living and entertaining excellence. Holding exceptional eye-catching appeal every step of the way, the family-sized home showcases a seamless transition from beautifully preserved period character at the front to the striking contrast of a soaring open-plan contemporary design at the rear. A formal lounge and separate dining provide elegant venues for hosting friends while the informal family/meals area lends itself to social casual get-togethers. The kitchen at the heart of the home is a chef's dream with its commercial-style oven and cooktop, butler's pantry, stone benchtops, continuous hot water and extensive storage. A huge north-facing covered deck with pull-down see-through blinds functions as an idyllic indoor-outdoor room regardless of what Melbourne's ever-changing weather brings. Versatility is key to the large separate studio, which could be used as a home office, teenagers' retreat, gymnasium - the sky's the limit. All this is capped off by a downstairs master ensuite bedroom, which is set apart from the upstairs' three-bedroom, one-bathroom kids' zone to give everyone peace and privacy. Advantaged with access via a service road, this illustrious home also features ducted heating throughout, cooling to the bedrooms, a split-system air conditioner, skylights and remote-controlled motorised blinds in the casual zone, twelve solar roof cells, video-monitored entry and multiple off-street parking behind remote driveway gates. Close to Packer Park, Ormond Station, schools, locals shops and Koornang and Centre Roads' retail and dining-out venues.","SOLD - $1,105,000","4
