whittington-vic-3219,2 Hickey Street WHITTINGTON VIC 3219,"Surprise! A home with size
Room to move is certainly promised at this huge 33sm 4BR residence. Home living couldn't be easier with a generous, flexible open floor plan and comfortable, light-filled rooms. The brick residence is a fabulous find, offering close proximity to schools and shopping centres. From the street, you wouldn't expect the front door to lead to an expansive living area boasting an exclusive bar, casual lounge and meals area, formal dining and a separate lounge room on a lower level. Brick and timber features are noticeable throughout, and a wood fire creates added warmth to the home which has ducted
heating and split system heating and cooling. The easy flow of the living area means entertaining is simple, especially with the fully equipped kitchen offering plenty of space to prepare meals before mingling around the adjacent bar. At the rear of the home is the laundry, main bathroom with spa, and four big bedrooms including main with walk-in robe and en-suite. If a home with size is what you're looking for, this fabulous home set on a large beautifully landscaped 677m2 block will be hard to surpass.
