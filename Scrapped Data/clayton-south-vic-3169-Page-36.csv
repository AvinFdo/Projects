clayton-south-vic-3169,34 Mallawa Street Clayton South VIC 3169,"A CLASSIC HOME ON AROUND 704SQM
A much loved family home that has been loved and cared for over many years, it is now time for a new generation to take over and decide the next chapter in this classic home's life. Set on around 704sqm the home is largely original and would be ideally suited to a renovation and update where you can add some modern style and significant value. And if you do this there could still be room in the backyard to build another unit or townhouse (STCA) that would always be in high demand. The home features a separate lounge that links to the meals area and kitchen with gas oven/stove. There are 3 bedrooms and a family bathroom plus a separate toilet and extras including a food preparation room and ducted heating. Outside there is an extensive patio, vegie patch, a garage and separate workshop plus the huge bonus of a water bore and pump. Backing onto Keeley Park the home is also just minutes away from buses, Westall Primary School, Westall Secondary College and central Clayton.","SOLD - $682,000","3

Even with a quick inspection of this classic home you can clearly see it has been beautifully maintained throughout its life and its condition is testament to its caring long term owners. Resting on a flat block measuring around 1,008sqm, the home is a prime candidate for further development where you could keep the home and build behind, or simply start from scratch and design a stylish modern unit development (all options are STCA). Behind its pale painted facade you find a warm and inviting home featuring a generous lounge room with gas heater and a split system air conditioner plus a meals area integrated in to the pristine kitchen and a separate study or work area. There are 3 robed bedrooms and a family bathroom that is complemented by a laundry with additional shower facilities and a separate toilet. Outside, you find a large covered patio for entertaining and a massive yard with great potential for tradesmen and hobbyists with the massive 4 car garage plus workshop a great bonus. It's even well positioned with schools and central Clayton's shops, cafes, buses and trains all nearby.","SOLD - $910,000","3
