curlewis-vic-3222,8 Peace Road Curlewis VIC 3222,"Who Says Size Doesn't Matter!
I simply cannot think of another property in today's market that boasts unrivalled 'size n scale' and yet still delivers a warm welcoming 'home' feel.
Positioned in what is quickly becoming known as the Paris end of Curlewis is this quality built 'one of a kind'. A free flowing open plan design was born from a building brief dedicated to establishing a family home of generous proportions which are further enhanced by high ceilings, excellent storage solutions and ALL the modern comforts.
The master bedroom is an enviable size and is complete with an ensuite and walk in robe. A northerly orientation ensures it is bathed in lovely natural light. The 2nd bedroom continues with the theme of generous proportions (3.8m x 3.5m approximately) and has floor to ceiling built in robes. The remaining 2 bedrooms also have built in robes.
The kitchen is a genuine 'headturner'; dual expansive Caesor stone bench tops compliment crisp white cabinetry and charcoal tiled splash back creates a lovely contrast. Stainless steel appliances and believe it or not a wrap around walk in pantry spans wall to wall (6m approximately) ensures this kitchen is one of the finest in today's property market. The kitchen is undoubtedly the hub of the family home and an open plan kitchen/family/meals ensures the home meets the practical needs of a growing family. A 2nd and separate living area offers further flexibility to what already is a very adaptable floor plan.
Glass sliding doors from the kitchen zone offer a lovely seamless connection to an expansive outdoor entertaining zone; complete with exposed aggregate concrete and a beautiful sheltered area for an early coffee or a late wine. Cool summer breezes from Corio Bay are a lovely reminder of how close you are to the water's edge.
A generous land holding of approximately 583m2 and frontage of 17.2m offers side access via dual colour bond gates.
A wonderful home ready for the next chapter!","SOLD - $520,000","4
