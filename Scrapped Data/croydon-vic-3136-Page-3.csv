PLEASE CONTACT AGENT TO ARRANGE A PRIVATE INSPECTION

This large 864m2 (approx.) corner block is occupied by a single-level residence that is in need of a little tender loving care. Big rewards are waiting for the shrewd buyer who can see the potential in renovating the existing dwelling, building a new home or perhaps developing the land and constructing units in its place (subject to council approval).

Beyond the solid brick exterior, the home features a comfortable lounge with natural floorboards, neutral tones and large windows inviting sunlight into the room. The family area provides a second space for relaxation, leading outdoors to an enclosed entertaining zone to expand the available living options.
Light filled, the kitchen is fitted with abundant cupboard space and comprises a 900mm dual-fuel cooker, dishwasher, breakfast bar and adjoining meals area. The tiled floor and splashback offer a practical finish while the contrast between the benchtops and cabinetry are also appreciable.
The large master features a walk-in robe and full ensuite boasting a spa and shower, quietly positioned away from the additional three robed bedrooms which are zoned together. The nearby bathroom incorporates a separate bath, shower and adjoining toilet. Further benefits include; gas ducted heating, evaporative cooling, multiple split system air-conditioning units, sunblinds, shed/workshop and bungalow.
The home is conveniently located only a short stroll from Dorset Recreation Reserve, Merrindale Shopping Centre, Tarralla Creek, Croydon Gums Kindergarten, bus stop, Dorset Primary School, Swinburne TAFE, as well as being in close connection with Croydon Railway Station, Tintern Grammar, hospitals, tennis courts, Croydon Memorial Pool and EastLink freeway.
