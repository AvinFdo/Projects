kangaroo-flat-vic-3555,40 William Drive Kangaroo Flat VIC 3555,"ENTERTAINERS MODERN HAVEN
A beautifully refurbished home offering a contemporary and entertainer's lifestyle welcome home to 40 William Drive.
The owners have poured love and attention into every detail of this property's modern refurbishment, and the moment you step onto the landscaped front yard you'll truly feel the quality behind it.
Glide along your stylish stone path up the front door and inside you're greeted by your light and bright open concept living, dining and kitchen.
The gourmet kitchen is sure to impress from its brand-new quality appliances, subway tiling, abundance of storage including soft close draws throughout and extra wide fridge nook.
Peer down the hallway and you'll discover the home's sleeping quarters, main bathroom and laundry.
The master suite offers plenty of natural light, floor to ceiling mirrored built-in robes and a quality refurbished modern ensuite.
Decorative floor to ceiling tiling, stunning mirror, deep bath tub and floating vanity make the main bathroom a standout.
Step outside into your grand entertaining space perfect for hosting large parties and gatherings. The use of materials beautifully compliments each other; from the tiered timber decking, wire railing and large covered patio with stylish fan.
Relax and unwind with friends on a warm summer's night while overlooking the kids running around the spacious backyard complete with established lawns and oversized garden shed.
Set on a spacious block size and close to Kangaroo Flat's popular shops, healthcare and department stores, this property won't last long. An inspection is a must. Contact agents Marc Cox or Justin Pell.","SOLD - $379,000","3
