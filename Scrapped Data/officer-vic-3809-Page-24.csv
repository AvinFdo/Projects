Sitting proudly in arguably the best pocket in the ‘Grandvue Estate’ Officer, this immaculately presented Carlisle built home stands as testament to our vendor’s efforts to build a warm, inviting family home, that anyone would be delighted to call their own.

The opulent entrance to this four bedroom home will take your breath away as you pass the large master bedroom with walk in robe and an ensuite with the convenience of his and her vanities. The three large remaining bedrooms are serviced by a modern central bathroom offering bath and separate shower and finished with the quality fittings you would expect in a house of this calibre.
There are living areas aplenty. A striking formal lounge with electric digital illuminated glass fireplace, is the perfect place to entertain on those cold winter nights or just to relax with a good book. A second living area and dining area are overlooked by a stunning kitchen complemented by 900mm stainless-steel appliances, stone bench tops and a walk-in pantry spacious enough to cater for the growing family. The home theatre room is the perfect area for the family to watch their favourite movies, or for the kids to enjoy whilst mum and dad relax in the more formal areas.
Added extras to this wonderful residence include, a large undercover decked outdoor area, ideal for entertaining, a low maintenance landscaped rear yard and a large oversized two car garage with internal access to the home.
This meticulously kept home is only moments away from St Clare’s Primary School, St Francis Xavier College, St Clare's Kindergarten and just a short drive to Arena Shopping Centre, Cardinia train station, freeway entrance and opposite beautiful rolling hills complete with its own resident kangaroos.
