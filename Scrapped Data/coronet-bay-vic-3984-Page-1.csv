coronet-bay-vic-3984,51 Scenorama Rd Coronet Bay VIC 3984,"Character and Charm with WOW FACTOR!!
This fully renovated and freshly painted home with floating floors on a 589sqm block instantly beckons an inspection with a welcoming bull nose veranda and front porch. Upon entering this appealing home the first thing that grabs your attention is the fantastic living zones. Both of the spacious rooms have wall to wall bi-fold doors that open out to a full width rear deck, perfect for getting together with family and friends and entertaining. The open plan kitchen facing the deck has electric cooking, stainless steel appliances, deep cupboards and a large island bench with stone top, all in a modern, high gloss finish that compliments the rest of the renovations. The house still retains some of its original charm with ornate skirting, leadlight front door and high ceilings, exuding a feeling of homeliness and warmth.
The 3 generous bedrooms with built in robes and large windows to bring in natural light are at the front of the home, and the bathroom, powder room and ensuite have all been updated as well. There are two split system heating/cooling units to keep year round temperatures at desired levels and access from the carport into the house makes getting the groceries in easy on a rainy day. A fully enclosed rear yard with 7ft fencing assures privacy, with plenty of room for play space or shedding. A wide driveway with a turning angle in it leads to the carport that is fitted with sensor lights. The low maintenance front garden is designed to leave you with more time to spend doing the things you love. The Coronet Bay safe swimming beach is 5 minutes away as are the licensed general store/post office and newly opened chemist. Major shopping centres are within 25 minutes and the dual lane Bass Highway makes commuting easy in either direction. There is a local Primary School and long Day Care Centre nearby, add all these amenities together and you will see that this property is in the ideal location for the sort of lifestyle that only the country and coast can offer.
