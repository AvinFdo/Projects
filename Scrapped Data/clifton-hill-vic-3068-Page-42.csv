An exceptional low-maintenance lifestyle opportunity in one of Northcote's most exclusive streetscapes, this impeccable residence is sure to make a lasting impression with free-flowing design, abundance of light throughout and uninterrupted outlook over All Nations Park. Flawlessly presented, the home's warm and inviting interior comprises three bedrooms (large master) all with built-in robes, together with a private ensuite, main bathroom with freestanding tub and guest powder room (third WC). Spacious and sun-drenched, the versatile open-plan living/dining area is further enhanced by a well-appointed kitchen complete with glass-tile splashbacks, stainless steel cooking appliances and dishwasher. Ducted heating, evaporative cooling, alarm system and video intercom all add to the appeal, along with ducted vacuum, square-set ceilings throughout, concealed laundry facilities and under-stair storage space. Double doors from the living area reveal a wonderfully private north-facing back garden with entertaining area and high hedges for added privacy, front balcony (from the master bedroom) with park views, plus the advantage of an internally-accessed garage (remote-control) and additional driveway parking space. Location perfection, it's also walking distance to High Street cafes and trams, shops and supermarkets, as well as Northcote Aquatic Centre and popular schools (zoned to Wales Street Primary School and Northcote High School).

Please also register your interest to attend the auction so that we can ensure compliance with the latest regulations and be contacted in the event the property is going to be sold prior.
Nestled in a much-loved village pocket of Fitzroy North, this charming Victorian certainly offers more than meets the eye. Unassuming from the street, its expanded two-level floorplan, modern enhancements and generous outdoor zones reward closer inspection.
Positioned in an intact row of eight terraces, the home's architecturally impressive interior highlights a fusion of the classic and the contemporary. For the former, see its hardwood floors. For the latter, see its ducted heating and split-system air-conditioning.
Downstairs offers a front bedroom, sky-lit central living room with built in joinery, bathroom, laundry, and an open-plan kitchen with timber-top island bench, ample cupboard space, stainless steel cooking appliances and dishwasher. An adjacent dining area overlooks a Mediterranean paved courtyard with pedestrian ROW access.
Upstairs, the master suite with full-width robes and ensuite bathroom opens up to a spectacular rooftop terrace with sweeping neighbourhood and city views. This fully decked area is the home's showpiece. Bathed in light from multiple directions, it is a feature you will not find elsewhere in this heritage precinct.
This unique home is in the beating heart of the St Georges Road Village. Tightly-held, it is adored by locals: offering direct access to the Fitzroy North Library, much-loved bars, cafes, eateries and bakeries, and eclectic retail outlets. With six schools (including North Fitzroy Primary School) within a kilometre of the front door , the location's appeal is capped off by its close proximity to the Capital City and Merri Creek Trails, as well as the lush expanse of the iconic Edinburgh Gardens.
