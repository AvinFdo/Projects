white-hills-vic-3550,49 Raglan Street WHITE HILLS VIC 3550,"Capitalise on a solid investment - walking distance to Botanic Gardens
A typically solid 'cream-bricker', this home also has extra appeal. Wide corner windows in the large, gas-heated loungeroom frame views of the landscaped front garden. The meals area & kitchen has an electric side-by-side stove amongst an abundance of original cabinetry. Serviced by a neat three-piece bathroom and separate toilet, all three bedrooms can accommodate queen-sized beds, all have ceiling fans and two have built-in robes. Evaporative cooling is ducted throughout. Beneath the nine-foot ceilings, floorboards can be repolished to add a fine finish. Replastering the laundry, installing a trough, replacing some skirting-boards and tiling the bathroom will complete this very inviting home. In the well-fenced backyard, there is plenty of space to extend if desired. Drive through the single carport to a garage plus workshop that has concrete floor and power. Set in a lovely area with the Botanic Gardens at the end of the street, it is right around the corner from shops and a primary school, plus just a few doors away from a pre-school. Home, sweet home!

white-hills-vic-3550,2 Skibo Heights White Hills VIC 3550,"When only quality will do!
You can just tell when a home has been built without short-cuts. This three-bedroom home, on an elevated and beautifully landscaped site, has been built with exacting standards and an eye for quality.You can tell, the moment you step onto the high-gloss ceramic floor tiles that grace the entrance, kitchen and other wet areas, and reflect light throughout the house. You can also see it in the quality of fittings and surfaces.With multiple living areas, thereâ??s plenty of space for a family, but the low-maintenance features of the property also make it appropriate for retirees and homebuyers who may have thought a townhouse was their only option.The open-plan kitchen, meals and living space really shines. With cupboards finished in gloss white, including a large corner pantry, the kitchen also has s/s DW gas hot plates and electric oven, granite-look benchtops and internal access to the double-car garage. Thereâ??s plenty of room for a dining setting as well as a dedicated lounge area. The main bedroom continues the quality theme, with a large walk-in wardrobe and superb en suite with all the trimmings, including a double basin. Bedrooms two and three each have built-in wardrobes and thereâ??s also a study nook off the hallway that makes wonderful use of the available space.The property is perfectly set up for outdoor living, with glass doors leading from the meals area to the undercover entertaining area. The garden is combination of lush lawn and tiered garden beds behind timber retaining walls. Thereâ??s gated access at both sides of the house, 2000 litres of rainwater storage, and a Colorbond workshop (approx 4m x 4m) a concrete floor.Close to schools and the Bendigo Creek Linear Park, the location just adds to the many features of this outstanding home.

Behind the neat and formal exterior of this lovely home, you'll find a breath taking, expansive interior. The layout of this home is such that it offers a unique and exciting way to live.

Walking further into the house and the main bedroom alone, will convince prospective buyers that this is the home they have to have. The bedroom's huge en suite and spa bath will make going away for the weekend a poor choice indeed. But the loveliest feature of the bedroom is the private, enclosed patio which leads off it, an ideal place for parents to retreat to and enjoy the beautiful spring air. Further into the house the open living room is divided into dining and living spaces where the family can watch TV together, eat or simply retreat. The kitchen is beautifully appointed with a walk-in pantry, oven and five burner gas top. There is also a built-in microwave oven and dishwasher. The house has ducted heating and cooling throughout. The three bedrooms at the other end of the house have built- in robes, a beautifully appointed bathroom and second toilet. The real sale clincher at this end of the house is the theatrette wired and set up for showing movies. The covered, paved entertainment area features an overhead fan for those hot days and the newly landscaped garden is low maintenance. At the back of the house, the wired shed has a concrete floor. A double garage can be accessed from the house interior.

white-hills-vic-3550,115-123 St Killian Street WHITE HILLS VIC 3550,"Rare Development Opportunity
There are some who will look at this home on two separate titles totalling one-and-a-half acres (6070 square metres), and see the potential for multiple units (STCA), especially given that it's a rare opportunity to develop one of the last sizeable allotments in the area; and then others who will look and see a solid, light-filled four-bedroom home with a delightful ambience surrounded by a garden enthusiastically nurtured over many years. You can't do better than a heavenly home in a saintly street and this four-bedroom home fits the bill. Open-plan living is at one end while the bedrooms and bathroom are at the other. Large windows open up the home and frame aspects of the restful garden - flowers, foliage and trees - all round. The kitchen and meals area is roomy and bright. A wide two-door pantry stocks enough supplies for a big family and the gas cooktop and one-and-a-half-ovens caters for big numbers. Sliding doors open onto a long patio. For more formal occasions the dining room is ideal and opens off a spacious lounge both of which take in those superb views. Ducted gas heating and evaporative cooling are throughout. Two of the four bedrooms have generous built-in wardrobes and all have ceiling fans. There's also a two-piece bathroom, separate toilet and laundry. Externally, apart from the magnificent garden, there is a ripper of a double garage and workshop, 10m x 12m, steel-framed and solid brick, containing a basin and toilet and featuring a concrete floor, power, light and phone connection. There is also a second, smaller steel-framed shed. Offered with vacant possession.",SOLD - Price Withheld,"4
