croydon-north-vic-3136,55 Nangathan Way CROYDON NORTH VIC 3136,"THE PINNACLE OF FAMILY HOMES
Family function couldn't be made easier with a house like this. Dressed to impress the busiest of households, this gorgeous corner property on 748m2 (approx.) that overlooks the leafy neighbourhood couldn't be better positioned or appointed if it tried.
Arranged over three levels, the lower level is the icing on the cake for this home. Staged as a self-contained unit that would make a great home based business, a private retreat for growing teenagers or young adults who haven't quite made the move to flee the nest yet, or for frequent extended family members or guests.
Complete with a living/meals area, mezzanine bedroom, bathroom/laundry, kitchen and its own Inverter heating and cooling system, this modern escape from the rest of the household is a genius after thought.
The upper two levels accommodate four bedrooms with robes, one of which has ensuite access to a bathroom downstairs; the master bedroom has a full ensuite with bath, whilst the larger family bathroom upstairs comfortably services the other bedrooms and kids retreat.
Dividing the formal lounge and dining room from the casual retreat of the family room and meals area is a family sized kitchen with the warmth of timber cabinetry and the practicality of a 900mm stainless cook top, a wall oven and a dishwasher.
Flowing out to the elevated deck encourages easy outdoor living and entertaining that's surrounded by a picture perfect outlook to the walking tracks and reserves across the road.
There's an impressive selection of Public and State schools nearby, its a short drive to McAdam Square shops or to Chirnside Park, whilst bus services frequent the surrounding streets that connect to nearby shopping centres and schools.
Added appointments include: 9 ft ceilings, ducted heating, evaporative cooling, ducted vacuum, outdoor 8 seater spa, a 10,000 ltr water tank, plenty of storage and cupboard space inside and out, and a remote double garage.","SOLD - $740,000","5

PRIOR OFFERS INVITED!
Open For Inspection: Saturday 3rd May, 12.30pm-1.00pm.
Quality vacant land is definitely at a premium but when you get a big block of approximately 1500 square metres with huge views over the treetops to distant mountains, great privacy and awesome location, then its just about priceless.
Beautifully positioned at the end of a long, private driveway, the block is also well treed to give it a sensational natural environment and has a park and bus stop within a few hundred metres.
Schools, shops and most other services and facilities a family will want are also easily accessed by a reasonable walk or short drive in the car.
Aside from the views, the other appealing feature of the block is the fabulous building envelope that will let you design your dream home (STCA) to fit in the setting perfectly and at the same time make the most of the views over the Yarra Valley and towards Kinglake.","SOLD - $277,500",,Vacant land,Sold by private treaty 3 May 2014,"118 Exeter Road, CROYDON NORTH VIC 3136 was last sold in 2016.","ALL
