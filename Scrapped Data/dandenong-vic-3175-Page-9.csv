This extra large two bedroom unit is on the market for the first time in almost 25 years. The location and layout are just 2 reasons why owners have been retaining their property in this small group of well maintained units.
The formal entry opens into the bright sunny lounge room with both North and South facing windows. There is an additional separate dining/study/TV room that you don't get in the average unit, and an original but clean meals/kitchen area with an almost new oven.
The two bedrooms are located around the central bathroom and there is a separate laundry as well.
Add to this the private courtyard area with direct access to the lock up garage, a second carpark, front verandah and well cared for gardens and all is here for a long tenure by any new owner.
Macpherson Street is one of the top 5 streets in Dandenong as it has a wide street, lots of trees and is an easy stroll to the Dandenong Market, Plaza, Railway Station, transport, churches, schools and more.
