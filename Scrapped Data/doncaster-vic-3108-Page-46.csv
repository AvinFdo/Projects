doncaster-vic-3108,13/75-77 Tram Road Doncaster VIC 3108,"Position, Privacy and Your Own Backyard
Enjoying a peaceful position at the rear of a safe and secure complex, this spacious and immaculately presented apartment benefits from a rare design focus that is far from the norm. Your eye is immediately drawn to the unique curvature of the East facing balcony as you enter the home, which connects seamlessly with the bright open plan living, kitchen and dining space. With plenty of room for the couches, dining table and chairs, the living/dining area is a real highlight. Incorporating split-system heating and cooling, wooden floorboards and access to the sparkling kitchen, it's a place you'll love spending time. Caesar stone bench tops compliment stainless steel gas cooking, an under bench oven and range hood in an open kitchen that has a breakfast bar and ample storage. Past the convenient placed European laundry, two spacious bedrooms at the rear have dual built-in robes and are central to the modern main bathroom which has a separate corner shower, bath and vanity. Perhaps the pinnacle of this impressive package is reserved for outside where not only does the almost property length balcony provide a pleasant place to sit and relax but incorporates a small staircase that leads down to a private backyard. Something rarely seen attached to an apartment of this calibre, this outdoor space has a paved seating area, privately planted trees, storage shed and a barked play space - meaning both the kids and pets will be happy out here. The additions of a secure underground car park and storage cage, stylish fixtures and fittings and modern window furnishings further separate this apartment from the rest. Located walking distance to the magnificent Westfield Shoppingtown, close to Doncaster primary and secondary schooling and public transport, and with great connection to Doncaster Road, Eastland and the city via Eastlink, this exciting offering must appeal to both investors and those looking to take their first step onto the property ladder.","SOLD - $460,000","2
