kennington-vic-3550,16 Allison Street Kennington VIC 3550,"Sophistication Meets Convenience
This impeccably kept Paul Gray creation is ideal if seeking a perfectly positioned, sophisticated family residence in a wide street. Located in a highly regarded, tightly-held part of the city, it's within easy walking distance of a variety of amenities. Schools, uni, sports and recreation reserves, shopping as well as medical services and even the CBD can all be reached on foot.
Fully landscaped yet low maintenance, pencil pines and box hedges formalise the gardens with vertical and lineal dimensions. Square-edge terraced retaining walls mirror the crisp architectural outline of the home's exterior to striking effect. Entirely separated and completely integrated into the external design, 2 paved outdoor living zones are equally refined.
Indoors, rich toffee-toned hardwood floors flow underfoot, contrasting with contemporary mid-grey carpets. Matching timber floating vanities and frameless screen walk-in showers feature in ensuite and bathroom with spa. Master bedroom owns enormous walk-in robe, other 2 bedrooms built-in robes, with plenty more storage plus ducted heating and cooling throughout.
Living areas are at opposite ends of the abode, one with open fire. Double doors to a study nook and a dining room open to the huge kitchen are aptly placed at the heart of the home. An immense central island harbours a wine fridge plus some of many pot drawers. Small appliance cupboards, 4-door pantry, dishwasher, ceramic cooktop and stone benchtops also impress in this high-end kitchen.
A double garage and 7.3m x 5.8m shed with rear access and water to trough await to park cars you may rarely require whilst residing at this superb address!

kennington-vic-3550,7 Dale Street Kennington VIC 3550,"1950s CLASSIC STUNNER IN SOUGHT AFTER LOCATION
This unique and impressive 1950s American style home in one of Kennington's most sought after neighbourhoods can only be described as a must-to-be-seen!
Set on a generous 1158sqm block in a quiet court location, every inch of the property has been meticulously cared for and still boasts its original appeal.
The much loved one-owner residence offers an abundance of storage throughout, three light and bright bedrooms with large built-ins and ornate windows, a recently updated bathroom and two extra living spaces to make your own; a study, sunroom, craft room or an additional bedroom.
From the original hardwood flooring, pristine wallpaper, impressive vintage doors and large picture windows with baroque fittings offers you the chance to live the nostalgia of a stylish time in history in today's modern world.
The kitchen is a standout with its American style influence featuring an abundance of overhead cupboards and built-in diner nook.
A brick storage room with toilet, single car garage, rear yard vehicle access, lock up garden shed and side carport surrounded by immaculate gardens completes the outside features of this property.
Another unique standout is the thoughtfully designed front pergola; allows the morning sun to beautifully warm the family room through its floor to ceiling windows and double glass doors, while also angled to block out the summer heat.
Refurbishing and updating this home would be idyllic with its clean designs and Scandinavian influence creating the perfect foundations to bring into what we now know as mid-century modern.
Ducted evaporative cooling throughout.

kennington-vic-3550,100 Edwards Rd Kennington VIC 3550,"POSITION - QUALITY - DESIGN with No Car Required
Literally, just across the road from Strath Village Shopping Centre, close to schools, pool, gym, eateries and almost everything else - and the CBD just a few bus stops away, this two bedroom BV home decorated in neutral tones is ideal for those wanting low maintenance living with all facilities within a short stroll.
The home offers a spacious open plan lounge-dining room featuring cathedral ceilings and exposed beams. A ceiling fan and a Daikin inverter split system provide excellent heating and cooling, a gas space heater provides an alternative heat source if required. Light floods in from the large windows on the North side controlled by vertical blinds and internally operated external sun blinds. Sliding glass door access from the lounge leads to the adjacent fully glass-walled sun-room - an area just perfect for cosy relaxation.
The updated kitchen has great storage - lots of handy landscape drawers! - Bosch 5 burner ceramic hot-plate, large rangehood and a Bosch wall oven.
There is an abundance of storage to be had, with cupboards in the passageway, laundry and both bedrooms have a full wall of built-in, fitted robes. The second bedroom has a Study Nook built into one side of the BIR's. Very thoughtful use of space is a feature of this small home. Practicality continues in the bathroom which has a full length vanity bench and shelf, dual flush toilet and shower.
Accessed via the good sized laundry, a handy ramp leads to shade covered and bricked tiled rear and side yards with lush established gardens, storage shed and a single carport. The attractive front garden provides privacy as well as pretty vistas from the living areas.
And what convenience! Across the road is the wonderful Strath Village and Kennington Shopping complex. Up the road to the left you will find assorted shops, Aldi and a Medical Centre. A short distance to the right is the Brennan Park Pool, Bendigo South East College and La Trobe University. No Body Corporate, own single title, this is a brilliant buy in a brilliant position that you rarely see on offer. So don't delay.
