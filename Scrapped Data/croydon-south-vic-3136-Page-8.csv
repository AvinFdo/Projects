Reap the development rewards of a large 945sqm block (STCA) or bring the family and imagine the lifestyle that could be yours with this immaculate home that was designed with low-maintenance living in mind. Featuring a smart, family-friendly floor plan with two living zones, easy-care rich floating floorboards throughout the light-filled living spaces and a super-sized back yard – what’s not to love? The kitchen/meals zone is the hub of the home and is well designed with gorgeous tiled splashback, soft closing draws, stylish white cabinetry and quality appliances including dual Belling Black oven/grill/cooktop and Domain rangehood. There is also a functional island bench with breakfast bar allowing you extra space to cook up a storm or chat to the kids about their day after school.

Flowing effortlessly off this central zone are two living spaces – a warm and inviting front lounge with expansive windows drenching the home in natural light and a rumpus zone at the rear with lush views of the backyard.
Accommodation comprises three well-sized bedrooms serviced by a central bathroom. The master is bright and spacious with expansive mirrored robes providing ample storage. The rumpus zone leads out to a sunny undercover alfresco zone perfect for summer barbeques or relaxing whilst you watch the children play beyond on the huge flat lawn that lends itself to games of footy or cricket, a trampoline and plenty of room for beloved pets to roam. Design the ultimate outdoor retreat or alternatively you can explore the development opportunities on offer (STCA) with a large shed providing rear access via a long driveway that can fit up to five vehicles.
Additional extras include deluxe plush carpet that presents as new in the bedrooms, space saving European laundry, ample storage and multiple off-street parking options. There is also ducted heating and evaporative cooling along with an additional wall heater and air-conditioning for seasonal comfort.

croydon-south-vic-3136,9a Faraday Road Croydon South VIC 3136,"STYLE AND SOPHISTICATION! IT’S THAT GOOD!
Gracing a private rear allotment behind just one other that occupies the original block, this exquisitely built home is only 18 months in the making and is the hallmark of what would complete a young family who love the balance of indoor and outdoor living, whilst also appealing to investor purchasers and retirees who are searching for low maintenance qualities.
Wonderfully laid out over two levels, this owner built property has been creatively designed; stylish to the eye, practical for everyday living, and out performs when entertaining friends. Upstairs accommodates three good sized bedrooms and two bathrooms, leaving the ground floor to effortlessly navigate your attention from the formal lounge/sitting room and access into the laundry and double garage, to opening out to a spacious open plan living and kitchen zone.
The kitchen will gives bragging rights; beautifully appointed with Snow White Caesar Stone bench tops, glass splash backs, matt black cabinetry, Tecknika appliances and Oliveri tapware and sinks. Above and below are feature Spotted Gum floors that flow out to the outdoor entertaining area and the private spaces where you and your fans can mingle around a fire pit while cooking under the BBQ area or enjoying the sunny Northerly light.
Enhanced with surround sound speaker systems inside and out, the atmosphere can be as chilled or lively as you want it to be, and with added extras like ducted heating, split system air conditioners, censor staircase lighting, a water tank, plus there’s the garden shed which includes a special built in dog kennel – Rover will love it! Finally – how good is the location. Situated toward the end of a “no through road”, the home is positioned quietly and conveniently to schools that include the well acclaimed Tintern Primary and Secondary schools.","SOLD - $770,000","3
