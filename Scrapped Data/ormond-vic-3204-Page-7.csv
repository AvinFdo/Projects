ormond-vic-3204,17 Leila Road Ormond VIC 3204,"Solid period home with so many options!
Its hard to imagine an opportunity that delivers as many options as this one! A huge piece of land. The perfect orientation. A solid home, rich with history. Which of these will be the one to tempt you? Ideally located moments to Ormond shops & station and close to bus routes, this proposition is nestled in a location where Kilvington Grammar, parklands and recreation are also readily available.
With its origins firmly set in the 1920s, the home features geometric leadlight motifs, ornate ceilings and warm timber trim which star through the formal lounge with open fireplace and peaceful dining room next door - whilst a splash of groovy orange brings alive a super-cool dining booth adjacent the central kitchen. Up-to four bedrooms plus two bathrooms come as part of the package, along with a gas fireplace, split system, laundry and garage.
With such charming foundations, a sympathetic update and considered renovation could see this home become a fine setting for todays families. Alternatively, the ultra-accommodating allotment of land could swallow up a brand-new showpiece with ease still leaving space for a pool, alfresco zone and more - instead, others may choose to pursue a multi-dwelling development made possible by the stunning dimensions (STCA).","SOLD - $1,590,000","4
