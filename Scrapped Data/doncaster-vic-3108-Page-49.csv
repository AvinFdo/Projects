doncaster-vic-3108,21 Stanton Street Doncaster VIC 3108,"Vacant And Cleared With Approved Plans And Permits!
Dodge the queues, save time and money and get ahead of the pack with this vacant 743sqm (approx.) block of land, which is already cleared and therefore ready to be developed with its approved plans and permits for two side-by-side Townhouses without delay!
The popular side-by-side design means both Townhouses receive their own exclusive portion of the wide 20m (approx.) frontage, as well as their own private driveway, own title and no Body Corporate fees. And as for the resale value - that's also very promising, too!
Once built, these innovative residences will stand only a short stroll from Birralee Primary School, which is one of the top 10 public primary schools in Victoria, as well as enjoying walking distance access to the popular Koonung Creek Trail and Katrina St Reserve and minutes to Westfield Shoppingtown, the Eastern Freeway and Koonung Secondary College - the No.16 public secondary school in the state.
Both Townhouses boast luxurious three-storey designs, with a sub-floor Master bedroom option with a private alfresco, three upper-floor bedrooms (second Master bedroom with ensuite) and vast open-plan living, study and alfresco on the ground floor.
Of course, there's also the option of ignoring what's already been approved and opting to build your dream family home instead (STCA).","SOLD - $1,201,000",743m²,Vacant land,Sold by private treaty 30 Jun 2017,"21 Stanton Street, Doncaster VIC 3108 was last sold in 2017.","ALL

The formal lounge and dining enjoy a peaceful aspect and refined character, while indoor-outdoor living is a design feature embraced by the open-plan living and separate retreat, both of which expand onto a stunning outdoor entertaining deck perfect for your morning coffee at sunrise or stargazing whilst entertaining friends and family.
Lengthy benches, loads of storage and stainless steel appliances accentuate the functionality of the first-class kitchen, while excellent storage options, warm timber floors, renovated laundry, split-system cooling, ducted heating, ducted vacuum and abundant natural light throughout completes the appeal of this brilliant family home.","SOLD - $1,640,000","6
